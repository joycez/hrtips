INSERT INTO `brochures` VALUES (1,'Alcohol and Drug Abuse','Employing and Accommodating Individuals  With Histories Of Alcohol Or Drug Abuse',4,'<h2>Why Is Drug And Alcohol Abuse Considered A Disability?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Clinicians and researchers commonly divide drug and alcohol consumption into three levels or stages of use: use, abuse, and dependence. While the use of drugs and alcohol does not generally rise to the level of an impairment that constitutes a disability, abuse and dependence do. Drug and alcohol abuse is characterized by intensified, regular, sporadically heavy, or &ldquo;binge&rdquo; use, and dependence is characterized by compulsive or addictive use.</p>  <p>Drug and alcohol abuse and dependence are classified as treatable illnesses by both standard diagnostic medical manuals, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10). These manuals also provide criteria for diagnos&shy;ing drug and alcohol abuse and dependence that focus on psychological, behav&shy;ioral, and cognitive symptoms. The impact of drug and alcohol use on social and occupational functioning is an important factor in evaluating the severity of an individual&rsquo;s condition. Many individuals with drug and alcohol problems can function in their jobs long after drug and alcohol use has begun to take its toll on family and social functioning. The resultant lost productivity and wages plus injury-related expenses cost the American workforce an estimated 100 billion dollars per year.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Protections Against Discrimination are Provided to Individuals With Drug and Alcohol Impairments?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Many employers do not realize that the Ameri&shy;cans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects individuals with drug and alcohol problems against discrimination in employment. Con&shy;fusion exists because the ADA includes both employment protections and sanctions re&shy;garding individuals with current drug prob&shy;lems.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The ADA protects people with past drug or alcohol problems and persons with current al&shy;cohol problems who are able to perform their jobs. By contrast, the ADA specifically ex&shy;cludes from the definitions of &ldquo;individual with a disability&rdquo; any person currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs, when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use. This exclu&shy;sion applies to individuals using illicit drugs as well as those using prescription medica&shy;tions unlawfully. Individuals who use drugs under the supervision of a licensed health care professional, however, are not using drugs illegally and are therefore protected against discrimination. In recent years there have been gains in creating drugs to assist individu&shy;als with recovery from drug addiction, and consequently it is more likely that former drug users will enter the workforce with specialized medication to assist with their maintenance of sobriety.</p>  <p>Similarly, the ADA protects individuals who are participating in a supervised drug rehabili&shy;tation program, have completed a treatment program, or have been rehabilitated and are no longer using drugs illegally.</p>  <p>When individuals are erroneously perceived as abusing drugs illegally, they are entitled to ADA protections. Because of societal attitudes about drug abuse, many individuals who have had past drug problems are wrongly perceived as being drug dependent even after they have been fully rehabilitated. Likewise, individuals who participate in methadone maintenance programs are also often per&shy;ceived as drug dependent, even though meth&shy;adone is a lawfully prescribed medication and individuals who participate in a methadone maintenance program are able to do every task -- even safety-related tasks -- that a person who is not receiving such treatment can do.</p>  <p>Workplace drug testing programs also create a pool of individuals who may be erroneously perceived as being drug dependent. Invari&shy;ably, drug tests inaccurately identify some individuals as drug users, whether because the drug test is performed incorrectly, substances in an individual&rsquo;s system are incorrectly iden&shy;tified as a drug, prescription medications are incorrectly identified as illicit drugs, or some other reason. The ADA prohibits discrimina&shy;tion against individuals who are erroneously regarded as being addicted to controlled substances because of a false positive drug test. However, the ADA does not protect an individual who is erroneously perceived as recreationally using illegal drugs on an oc&shy;casional basis, because in those circumstances the employer is not &ldquo;regarding&rdquo; the individual as having a substantially limiting impairment. This is a sensitive and complex area and many employers utilize drug testing policies that set forth specific steps for handling positive drug findings.</p>  <p>Individuals with current alcohol impairments that substantially limit one or more major life activities are protected against discrimination like any other individual with a disability. Alcohol is not considered a &ldquo;drug\" under the ADA, and, therefore, the individuals who current abuse alcohol are not excluded from the ADA&rsquo;s protection. Individuals with cur&shy;rent alcohol-related disabilities, like any other individual with a current disability, must be able to perform the essential functions of the job. In addition, the ADA specifically permits an employer to hold employees who abuse alcohol to the same performance and conduct standards applicable to all employees, even if that employee\'s problems are related to alco&shy;hol abuse.</p>  </div>  <h2>Timing of Drug Use</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Current illegal drug use excluded from ADA coverage does not mean drug use occurring specifically on the day of or within a matter of weeks before the employment action in ques&shy;tion. To determine whether such drug use is current, the employer must focus upon wheth&shy;er the individual has used drugs close enough to the time of the employment action to indi&shy;cate that there is a real and on-going problem. If an individual tests positive on a test for illegal drugs, that person will be considered a current drug user (provided that the test cor&shy;rectly indicates the illegal use of a controlled substance).</p>  <p>Casual drug use is not a disability under the ADA, regardless of when it occurred. Only individuals who are addicted, have a history of addiction, or are regarded as being addicted have an impairment under the law. Therefore, denying employment to job applicants solely because of a history of casual drug use would not raise ADA concerns. On the other hand, policies that screen out applicants because of a history of addiction or treatment for addic&shy;tion must be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the policies are job-related and consistent with business necessity. If safety is asserted as a justification for such a policy, then the em&shy;ployer must be able to show that individuals excluded because of a history of drug addic&shy;tion or treatment would pose a direct threat -- i.e., a significant risk of substantial harm -- to the health or safety of others or, perhaps, to themselves as well, that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.&nbsp; Because the ADA protects individuals who are participating in a rehabilitation program and those who have been rehabilitated (as long as they are not still using drugs illegally), em&shy;ployers should be careful about reaching back in time and taking adverse actions against individuals for drug use that occurred prior to treatment.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Medical Tests or Inquiries are Permitted to Determine Whether an Individual has a Drug or Alcohol Problem?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The permissible scope and timing of inquiries and tests relating to drug and alcohol use will depend on the specific information sought. An employer may ask applicants and em&shy;ployees about the current illegal use of drugs before or after extending a job offer and dur&shy;ing employment without violating the ADA, because an individual who currently uses illegal drugs is not protected under the ADA. The ADA also specifically states that tests for the current illegal use of controlled substances are not considered medical examinations.</p>  <p>An employer also may ask about past illegal drug use at the pre-offer stage so long as the question is not likely to elicit information about a disability. A question such as &ldquo;Have you ever used illegal drugs?&rdquo; or &ldquo;When did you last use illegal drugs?&rdquo; would be accept&shy;able. Questions about addiction would not be permissible at the pre-offer stage, but could be asked either after a job offer has been extended or during employment if the inquiry is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p>Generally, questions about lawful drug use are not allowed pre-offer because they are likely to elicit information about disability. However, if a person tests positive for illegal drug use, an employer could ask about lawful drug use as a possible explanation for the positive drug test.</p>  <p>When an employer obtains medical informa&shy;tion at the pre-offer stage, it must be careful not to use the information in a way that would violate the ADA. To avoid the possibility of this type of allegation, many employers choose to conduct drug testing after a conditional of&shy;fer of employment has been made. In all cases where an employer obtains medical informa&shy;tion from an inquiry or exam, the medical information must be collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate files and treated as a confidential medical record.</p>  <p>An employer could ask about drinking hab&shy;its at the pre-offer stage, such as whether a person drinks or has ever been arrested for driving while intoxicated, so long as the ques&shy;tion is not likely to elicit information about alcoholism. In contrast, questions about how much someone drinks or whether they have ever been in an alcohol rehabilitation program are not acceptable because they are likely to garner information about alcoholism. Alcohol tests may not be given pre-offer because they are considered to be medical tests. Inquiries relating to alcoholism or alcohol tests could be conducted post-offer, or at the employment stage if the inquiry or test is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Can an Employer Do To Ensure that an Individual is No Longer Using Drugs?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA permits employers to take reason&shy;able steps to ensure that an individual is no longer illegally using drugs. Employers are permitted to conduct drug tests and to obtain information from treatment programs in order to monitor drug use. If an employer has an employee assistance program (EAP), the EAP may be the best entity to conduct the follow-up.</p>  <p>While the ADA does not impose many restric&shy;tions on drug testing, employers are required to use accurate test procedures and to comply with any federal, state, or local law that regu&shy;lates drug testing.</p>  <p>An employer may require random alcohol testing of an employee who has undergone rehabilitation, even without evidence that the employee has recently been or is presently under the influence of alcohol, if it is reason&shy;able to believe that the employee would pose a direct threat in the absence of such testing. For example, random alcohol testing may be unwarranted in the case of a recently rehabili&shy;tated clerical employee but appropriate in the case of a health care employee who provides direct patient care.</p>  <p>When seeking rehabilitation information from a drug or alcohol treatment program, employ&shy;ers should be aware that federal regulations govern the release of drug and alcohol patient information by virtually all treatment pro&shy;grams. These regulations, in order to protect the confidentiality of individuals with drug and alcohol problems, require the execution of a detailed consent form before employers can receive treatment information, and they place strict limitations on the employer&rsquo;s use, main&shy;tenance and re-disclosure of that treatment information.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Accommodations Do Individuals with Drug and Alcohol Problems Need?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">Accommodations for individuals in recovery from a drug or alcohol problem will vary depending upon the requirements of their jobs and their length of time in recovery. For example, individuals who have recently completed a rehabilitaion program may need to participate in a structered, outpatient continuing care program on a regualr basis. Others who have been sober for a long time may participate in self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, in order to prevent relapse. Involvement in such continuing care may require some accomodation.</div>  <p>&bull; Structuring the work day so that less de&shy;manding tasks are required when fatigue occurs &bull; Adjusting supervisory methods, e.g., com&shy;municating assignments or instructions in writing or by e-mail rather than orally, or providing more detailed guidance or structure. &bull; Modifying a work schedule to permit an employee to pick up her daily methadone dosage or to attend an outpatient relapse prevention counseling session. &bull; Restructuring a job to relieve an employee of &ldquo;risky&rdquo; environments or tasks that may compromise recovery, e.g., expectations for socializing with clients or other em&shy;ployees who are known to be heavy alco&shy;hol users. &bull; Temporarily reassigning an employee in a safety-related position to a vacant non-safety sensitive position while he or she completes treatment. &bull; Reassigning an employee to an equivalent vacant position when the current supervi&shy;sor is too busy supervising other employ&shy;ees or serving the public to provide the necessary guidance or structure. In addition, because individuals with current alcohol impair-ments are protected against discrimination to the extent they can perform their job effectively and safely, employers are required to consider providing unpaid leave to permit an indi&not;vidual with a current alcohol impairment to attend an in-patient treatment program. In addition, if an employer provides paid leave to individuals who are obtaining medical treatment for a disability, the em&shy;ployer must provide the same benefit to an individual who is obtaining treatment for an alcohol problem. It is important to remember that some employ&shy;ees will need no accommodation, but simply a change in attitude regarding what an individual witha past drug or alcohol impairment can do. Persons in recovery are able to perform all jobs safely, including safety-realted jobs, and they pose no risk to others soley because of a past drug or alcohol addition. An employer\'s most important obligation under the ADA is to evaluate each individual\'s ability to do essential job tasks and make employment decisions based on the individual\'s qualifications and work performance.</p>  <h2>How Do Other Federal Laws Relating to Drug and Alcohol Use Affect the ADA\'s Standards?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">The ADA permits employers to comply with other federal laws and regulations that relate to drug and alcohol use. These federal stan&shy;dards include the Drug Free Workplace Act and standards established by the Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission relating to testing safety-sensitive employees for drug use and, in some cases, alcohol use. The stan&shy;dards established by these other federal laws and rules are consistent with the ADA and, for the most part do not impose additional restric&shy;tions on the rights of individuals in safety-related jobs. The drug testing regulations, in particular, cover a fairly narrow set of employees whose jobs directly affect safety. They require em&shy;ployees to comply with restrictions on off-duty drug and alcohol use and prohibit individu&shy;als who violate drug or alcohol rules from holding safety-sensitive jobs. The regulations give employers the right to determine when individuals who have tested positive for drug or alcohol may return to work in the safety-related position. Apart from these more stringent standards, the ADA does not permit employers to treat individuals with past drug or alcohol impair&shy;ments who hold safety-related jobs any differ&shy;ently from other employees.</div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This brochure was revewed and updated in 2011, by Dennis Moore, Director, Substance Abuse Resources and Disability Issues, RRTC on Drugs and Disability, who also updated the from the initial version in 2001.

A chair, desk, computer, lighting, and safety equipment could all be considered technology accommodations made for employees. Assistive technology is no different; it is simply any item that can assist an individual with a disability to succeed on the job. This brochure provides some definitions and a starting point for finding the right technology to meet the needs of your employees.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is Assistive Technology (AT)?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Assistive technology was first defined in the Technology-Related Assistance for Individuals with Disabilities Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-407) as &ldquo;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.&rdquo; Examples of assistive technology devices include:</p>  <ul>  <li>hearing aids</li>  <li>ramps that help people get in and around buildings more easily</li>  <li>wheelchairs</li>  <li>computer modifications to increase accessibility</li>  <li>electronic devices that make communication possible</li>  <li>equipment on the job that has been modified or customized</li>  <li>remote control devices that turn appliances, computers, lights, radio, etc. on and off</li>  <li>magnifier, talking books, closed circuit television, Braille note taking computer</li>  </ul>  <p><strong><em>Assistive technology services</em></strong> is defined as &ldquo;any service that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an AT device. An AT service can include: (1) evaluation of the AT needs; (2) purchasing, leasing, or acquiring the AT; (3) selecting, designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, maintaining, repairing, or replacing AT devices; (4) coordination and use of therapies, interventions, or services with AT devices; (5) training or technical assistance for individuals with disabilities, professionals, employers, or other individuals providing services to individuals with disabilities.&rdquo; Examples of technology services include:</p>  <ul>  <li>getting help to know what devices are available</li>  <li>getting help to know where to get services</li>  <li>getting help to determine what devices are needed</li>  <li>getting help to pay for devices</li>  <li>getting devices repaired</li>  </ul>  <p>Assistive technology includes devices and services that help people in their daily lives at home, work, school and the community.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Can AT Assist in the Implementation of the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act extends full civil rights and equal opportunities to people with disabilities in both the public and private sectors. Specifically, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of a physical or mental disability in employment, public services, public accommodations, and telecommunications. Assistive technology can play a major role in helping to realize the goals of the ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are some benefits of AT as it relates to the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p><strong><em>AT can play a critical role in complying with reasonable accommodations.</em></strong> The ADA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified persons with disabilities that will enable them to perform the essential functions of jobs held or desired. Providing a reasonable accommodation to a job applicant or an employee with a disability can include the acquisition or modification of equipment or devices. Some AT accommodation examples are:</p>  <p>Sally, born with cerebral palsy, uses an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device to talk with her fellow employees and to present speeches at conferences.</p>  <p>Jason was injured in a fall and uses a wheelchair. He continues to work at his office using equipment that is set on lower worktables and has front controls.</p>  <p>Marion, who sustained a head injury from a car accident, uses an electronic notebook to help her complete her day-to-day job-related tasks.</p>  <p>Employers may choose not to hire a qualified individual with a disability because they have a limited understanding or misperception of how the individual can perform the essential functions of the job with the use of AT. In addition, new technologies are consistently being developed, many of which include designs to accommodate individuals with disabilities. Therefore, employers need to realize that, like all workplace technology that consistently gets upgraded and improved, so, too, does AT.</p>  <p><strong><em>AT can play a vital role in ameliorating unnecessary risks to workers.</em></strong> Under the ADA, employers do not have to hire or employ a person with a disability who poses a direct threat, i.e., &ldquo;a significant risk to the health or safety of others that <strong>cannot be eliminated by a reasonable accommodation.</strong>&rdquo; For example, a store clerk with poor upper body control might use a cart to move heavy supplies rather than carrying them across the store and risk dropping them on others. A craftsman with cerebral palsy might use a low-tech vice grip or clamp to secure and direct a variety of tools and equipment as a way of reducing the risk of injury to co-workers.</p>  <p>Furthermore, an employer does not have to provide an accommodation if it can demonstrate that it would impose an &ldquo;undue hardship&rdquo; on its business, that is, a significant difficulty or expense to the current circumstances of the employer&rsquo;s business. To make this determination, one examines, among other things: the nature and net cost of the accommodation; the number of employees, type of operations and financial resources of the facility and the larger business entity of which it may be a part; and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility. If making the accommodation would impose an undue burden, the employer may offer the person with the disability an opportunity to provide his or her own accommodation or may assist that person in finding resources to pay for the accommodation. If employers think of accommodations as &ldquo;productivity enhancements&rdquo; similar to others in the workplace, then they become a cost of doing business.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Are Some Typical Accommodations Using AT?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>A few examples of the types of AT devices and services that provide reasonable accommodations for various types of disabilities are provided below.</p>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Blindness or Low Vision</span></p>  <ul>  <li>Optical character recognition system (also known as a scanner with speech output)</li>  <li>Text-based web browser with screen reading software or Braille output</li>  <li>Accessible company websites</li>  <li>Large-print materials</li>  <li>Audiotapes</li>  <li>Qualified reader</li>  <li>Brailler</li>  <li>Computer with voice output</li>  <li>Electronic note taker</li>  <li>Screen magnification product</li>  <li>CCTV (Closed Circuit Television system)</li>  <li>Optical magnifier</li>  <li>Large-print label</li>  <li>Raised lettering on room labels</li>  </ul>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Hearing Loss or Deafness</span></p>  <ul>  <li>Certified sign language interpreter</li>  <li>TTY (Teletype telephone)</li>  <li>Visual or tactile pagers for communication, instructions, and as an alerting system</li>  <li>Telephones with amplification devices and visual and auditory alerting systems</li>  <li>Fire alarms with visual and auditory alerting systems</li>  <li>Assistive listening devices (e.g., FM, infrared, loop systems, and/or closed-captioning decoders)</li>  <li>Captioned video training materials</li>  <li>Real-time captioning for conferences and audio streaming of web teleconferences</li>  </ul>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mobility Impairments </span></p>  <p><em>(Multiple Sclerosis [MS], Paraplegia, Quadriplegia, Post polio, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Repetitive Stress Injuries, etc.)</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Trackball for easier mouse manipulation</li>  <li>Touch screens</li>  <li>Ergonomic keyboard</li>  <li>Adjustable keyboard tray</li>  <li>Portable cart</li>  <li>Writing and grip aids</li>  <li>Page turners and book holders</li>  <li>Stand/lean stools</li>  <li>Adjustable height desks and work tables</li>  <li>Speech amplification systems</li>  </ul>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cognitive and Developmental Disabilities </span></p>  <p><em>(Mental retardation, autism, cerebral palsy, neurological conditions, etc.)</em></p>  <ul>  <li>IPhone</li>  <li>IPad</li>  <li>Telephone auto-dialer</li>  <li>Larger buttons on equipment</li>  <li>Memory aids (electronic notebook, pop-up timer on computer)</li>  <li>Communication device</li>  <li>Voice output with optical character recognition to read documents or use a reading pen</li>  </ul>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Learning Disabilities or Attention Deficit Disorders</span></p>  <ul>  <li>IPad</li>  <li>Reading template</li>  <li>Automatic line guide</li>  <li>Tape recorder</li>  <li>Computer with voice output</li>  <li>Floor fan or nature tape played on a stereo for white noise</li>  <li>Colored labeling</li>  </ul>  <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Psychiatric Disabilities</span></p>  <ul>  <li>Room partitions or enclosed office space to reduce noise and distractions</li>  <li>Video or audio conferencing meetings</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Myths About AT</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>There are many myths surrounding AT devices and services for individuals with disabilities. These misconceptions may impact attitudes and become invisible barriers to an individual&rsquo;s independence and productivity. Common misconceptions are:</p>  <p><strong><em>An AT device is a luxury. </em></strong>For someone with a disability who relies on AT to perform a critical function or achieve a desired goal in life, AT is very much a necessity. A computer is a necessary piece of equipment for anyone doing data entry even though it could be done with a pencil and paper. Just because a device makes a task easier or more convenient to do, does not make it a luxury.</p>  <p><em>&ldquo;For most people technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, however, technology makes things possible. In some cases, especially in the workplace, technology becomes the great equalizer and provides the person with a disability a level playing field on which to compete.&rdquo; </em></p>  <p><em>(A quote from Mary Pat Radabaugh, a former employee with the IBM Disability Support Center).</em></p>  <p><strong><em>AT is expensive and complicated. </em></strong>The majority of AT solutions are simple, inexpensive low-tech devices such as a hands-free telephone, magnifiers, or wood blocks to raise a desk or workstation, which can be found at the local hardware or office supply store. It may also be as simple as rearranging a workspace.</p>  <p>According to the Job Accommodation Network (JAN), more than half of all accommodations cost nothing to make, while the rest typically cost only $600.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> Most accommodations would therefore not likely impose an &ldquo;undue burden&rdquo; on any employer&rsquo;s business. With respect to AT, the cost can be shared by the employer, the individual, or third-party payers, such as the employer-supported health insurance for the employee, workers&rsquo; compensation, the state&rsquo;s department of rehabilitation services (also known as vocational rehabilitation), philanthropic organizations, and AT loan programs.

In reality, a person who is categorized as &ldquo;blind&rdquo; may retain some usable vision. The term &ldquo;legally blind&rdquo; designates vision of 20/200 or worse in the better eye (with best correction), or a field of vision restricted to 20&deg; or less. &ldquo;Vision impairment&rdquo; describes a variety of levels of vision loss, and &ldquo;severe vision impairment&rdquo; describes vision which can be corrected, at best, to 20/70.</p>  <p>Some people are born with no vision or significantly reduced vision. Others lose vision due to accidents or the natural aging process, usually starting in their 40s. Vision loss is sometimes sudden, or it may be gradual. Some conditions (diabetes, for example) cause vision to fluctuate from day to day.</p>  </div>  <h2>How does blindness affect employment?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>When a significant vision loss occurs, time off from work to receive adaptive training may be needed. Such instruction can allow a person to continue as a productive and dedicated employee.</p>  </div>  <h2>What fields employ people who are blind or visually impaired?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>With appropriate training and equipment, people who are blind or visually impaired have the same range of abilities as sighted people, including professional success as</p>  <ul>  <li>artists and musicians</li>  <li>boat builders</li>  <li>auto mechanics</li>  <li>fashion models</li>  <li>governors</li>  <li>teachers</li>  <li>lawyers</li>  <li>machinists</li>  <li>masseuses</li>  <li>mayors</li>  <li>production workers</li>  <li>story tellers</li>  <li>computer programmers</li>  <li>word processing specialists</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>The Americans with Disabilities Act</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Everyone in the workforce uses helpful technologies each day. Velcro fasteners on protective clothing, hand trucks, word processors &ndash; these and countless other tools allow us to accomplish things that would be difficult and sometimes impossible without them. Such supports enhance our productivity by reasonably accommodating our humanness.</p>  <p>Similarly, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that employers &ldquo;reasonably accommodate&rdquo; the limitations imposed by a person&rsquo;s physical or mental disability. Reasonable accommodation is defined as the modification or adjustment of a job, employment practice, or work environment that makes it possible for a qualified person with a disability to perform the essential functions of a job.</p>  <p>The ADA extends protections to all aspects of a job, so a reasonable accommodation may be required during the application process, on the job, in training, at the work site, and/or when considering promotions and layoffs. If job duties change, new accommodations may become necessary.</p>  <p>The ADA requires an employer to accommodate the individual with a disability unless doing so would cause an undue hardship. A hardship is &ldquo;undue&rdquo; if it would cause significant difficulty or expense to the current circumstances of the employer&rsquo;s business. To make this determination, one examines (among other things) the nature and net cost of the accommodation; the number of employees, type of operations and financial resources of the facility, and the larger business entity of which it may be a part; and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility. If the cost would impose an undue burden on the employer&rsquo;s business, the employer may offer the person with the disability an opportunity to provide his or her own accommodation or may assist that person in finding resources to pay for the accommodation. If employers think of accommodations as &ldquo;productivity enhancements&rdquo; (similar to others in the workplace), then they become a cost of doing business.</p>  </div>  <h2>What accommodations might be offered during the employee selection process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>During the hiring process, employers seek to determine whether applicants have the necessary skills, experience, education, and other background to perform the essential functions of the job. This is the same regardless of disability status; employers need similar information about every applicant in order to make effective hiring decisions. In order to provide equal access to this process, it is sometimes necessary to offer specific accommodations.</p>  <p>For instance, if a visual impairment prevents a person from reading and completing a printed job application, he or she may become discouraged and hesitate to apply (even if the job itself requires minimal vision). Potential employers can attract and retain qualified blind and/or visually impaired candidates by offering accessible options during the application process. Options might include:</p>  <ul>  <li>mailing the application to the candidate;</li>  <li>offering a walk-in applicant the opportunity to take the form home, get assistance to complete it, and return it by mail or in person; or</li>  <li>providing an electronic application to complete online.</li>  </ul>  <p>Similarly, specific information about accessibility can be helpful to an interviewee who is blind or visually impaired. An employer might appropriately offer any of the following kinds of assistance:</p>  <ul>  <li>driving directions (candidate may be able to drive using assistive technology, or may retain a driver);</li>  <li>location of the closest public transportation stop; and/or</li>  <li>assistance from the reception area to the interview location by asking, &ldquo;Would you like to take my arm?&rdquo; In this case, the candidate may lightly grasp your arm just above the elbow and follow a step behind you, or choose to follow you without assistance.</li>  </ul>  <p>As with any prospective employee, attention to non-verbal cues and respect for appropriate boundaries will facilitate the interview process. Assistance should be offered but not insisted upon, and a guide animal, if present, should not be petted or distracted.</p>  <p>Although all interviews require care to avoid using insensitive or biased expressions, there is no need to avoid normal, customary language and phrasings with an interviewee who is blind or visually impaired. Phrases such as the following are appropriate:</p>  <ul>  <li>&ldquo;Do you see what I mean?&rdquo;</li>  <li>&ldquo;Would you like to take a look at the work area?&rdquo;</li>  <li>&ldquo;I hope to see you again.&rdquo;</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>How can productivity be sustained and enhanced?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>When an ADA-required accommodation becomes necessary, employer and employee can work together to brainstorm and research equipment options and/or job restructuring. The person who requests an accommodation has lived (and perhaps worked) with his or her disability and may already know what will sustain productivity most effectively. Appropriate assistive technology (AT) may need to be acquired in order to provide proper accommodation. The term, &ldquo;AT,&rdquo; includes any item, piece of equipment, or product system (whether acquired commercially off-the-shelf, modified, or customized) that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. AT services include any service that directly assists an individual with a disability with the selection, acquisition, or use of an AT device.</p>  </div>  <h2>Low-Tech Assistive Technology</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>AT can enhance employee productivity, and it does not have to be complicated or expensive. Low-tech AT solutions include:</p>  <ul>  <li>magnification devices (e.g., handheld magnifiers);</li>  <li>a dot of silicon placed on a knob, switch, or button (permits a blind person to align the controls on a machine);</li>  <li>a wide, felt-tipped marker for writing file folder labels (readable to a person with a visual impairment);</li>  <li>electronic text and voice mail instead of written notes;</li>  <li>a human reader for printed and handwritten materials that cannot be converted electronically;</li>  <li>work hours that correspond with mass transit availability;</li>  <li>sharing or switching job tasks among employees to maximize strengths;</li>  <li>Braille labels on vending machines; and/or</li>  <li>accessible labels for parts bins.</li>  </ul>  <p>Employees who are blind or have low vision will be able to suggest additional, simple solutions.</p>  </div>  <h2>High-Tech Assistive Technology</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Adaptive software or hardware can provide enlarged screen displays, speech output, or Braille output. This AT has been developed for the Windows operating system. The Apple Mac can enlarge information on the monitor and includes a screen reader software package called Voiceover.</p>  <p>Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems (or &ldquo;reading machines&rdquo;) include a scanner and recognition software. Print materials are scanned into a computer and the information is displayed on a monitor. A person who is blind or visually impaired can access information through screen enlargement, a screen reader, or refreshable Braille display. Offices may have scanner/printer/copier systems which require only an additional adaptation. Prices for scanners range from $100 to $700. Optical Character Recognition software, designed for use by people who are blind, is priced between $100 and $1000. Some of the more popular scanning packages are Openbook, Kurzweil 1000, and Text Cloner. A stand-alone OCR system without a monitor costs about $2900.</p>  <p>Screen enlargement programs use software to enlarge text and graphics from 2X to 36X on a computer monitor. Using larger monitors or dual monitors will also help employees who use these enlargement programs. MAGic and ZoomText, the two leading screen enlargement programs, each cost about $600.</p>  <p>Screen reader systems provide speech output as a synthesized voice reading text from the computer monitor. Most screen readers have a robotic voice, but software programs are available to make them sound more human. Although some software that is mouse-dependent or highly graphical is more difficult for a screen reader to process, there are ways to address this. These programs give auditory feedback of on-screen content including menus, dialog boxes, text, and other messages commonly displayed in Windows. They cost between $500 and $1000. Popular screen reader programs include JAWS for Windows, Window-Eyes, and System Access.</p>  <p>Electronic Magnification Systems (also known as closed circuit television or CCTV) use a modified motion camera to magnify printed material and display it, usually on a 19&rdquo; monitor. This device permits a person who has some usable vision to read print materials and to fill out forms. CCTV systems are often the best way for a person with some functional vision to read printed material visually. Black and white systems are available, but most people opt for the variety of foreground and background colors offered by a color system at an average cost of $2500. Some portable systems use a hand-held camera that may connect to a TV. These systems cost between $500 and $1000. They require the user to hold the camera, which may present limitations for a person with a physical disability.</p>  <p>Braille output uses a refreshable Braille device to display up to 80 characters of text at a time. This allows an entire line of information to be read from a monitor. There is no typical price for a refreshable Braille device, but costs run about $110 per Braille cell (most have 40-60 cells). Popular refreshable devices include the BrailleNote, PACmate, and the Braille Sense. All three devices function as refreshable Braille output for the computer, and they are also stand-alone personal digital assistants (PDAs).</p>  <p>Braille documents can be created using a Braille translation program and a Braille embosser with special heavy Braille paper. Translation programs typically cost about $400, and embossers average around $3000.</p>  <p>All of these assistive software and hardware technologies were designed to work with the Windows operating system. They also work with most commercial software programs. Also, AT companies generally provide customer service to assist with compatibility.</p>  <p>When considering costs of accommodations, an employer should review expenses for the company\'s entire computer system and the overall financial resources of the facility before deciding whether the equipment needed to enhance a visually impaired worker&rsquo;s productivity is too expensive. In some cases, the individual who is blind may already have the needed equipment. Vocational rehabilitation services may also be able to assist. In general, well equipped work areas, individually organized by the workers who use them, are likely to maximize productivity.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tips for On-The-Job Training</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Employees who are blind or visually impaired need the same initial training for a new position as their sighted colleagues. Providing orientation to the company and the job, and considering whether verbal instruction alone or a combination of hands-on, written, and verbal learning is most effective will facilitate orientation for all new employees. Printed materials should be available in an accessible medium.</p>  </div>  <h2>Performance Management</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>In any workplace, the supervisor must establish an atmosphere that fosters productivity and quality work. Employees who are blind or visually impaired have the same career aspirations as other employees and can be expected to contribute similarly to these goals, provided that appropriate training and accessible materials are provided. Like others, they want to know when they are performing well and when they need to do things differently. Clear communication is essential, and performance appraisals should be conducted using the same criteria for all peer employees. If feedback is provided throughout the year, an annual performance appraisal should contain no surprises.</p>  <p>One way employers can support productivity in workers who are blind or visually impaired is by periodically reviewing adaptive equipment to ensure that it works well and meets employee needs. Upgrading when necessary can help employees who need AT to remain competitive in their fields. The local Vocational Rehabilitation Agency, Rehabilitation Center for the Blind, or rehabilitation service provider can provide more information about maintaining and upgrading AT to keep up with emerging technologies, product compatibility, and current pricing.</p>  </div>  <h2>Training and Promotion</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Providing the same opportunities for advancement (attending out-of-town training, speaking at professional conferences, training new workers) as for comparable employees allows workers who are blind or visually impaired to grow with and through their jobs, just as their sighted coworkers do. If accommodations are needed in order to have access to such opportunities, they should be provided as identified by the employee. In any case, employers can create a positive and productive work environment by using the same approaches and criteria for career planning and promotion for employees who are blind or visually impaired as they use for all employees.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'It was reviewed and updated in May, 2010,  by staff at the Rehabilitation Research and  Training Center on Blindness and Low Vision  at Mississippi State University. The original  brochure was developed in January, 1994, by  Mary B. Dickson, President, Creative Compliance  Management.',NULL,1,'Mary B. Dickson','J.

The brain is protected by the bones of the skull and by an intricate system of membranes, fluids and blood vessels. But, like anything else, the brain can be damaged.</p>  <p>The CDC estimates that about 1.7 million Americans experience a traumatic brain injury. Brain injury often results from a trauma to the head, but also occurs from infections, toxic exposures or when oxygen is denied to brain cells like in strokes or suffocation. Traumatic brain injury can result from a blow to the head, the head striking something or a force strong enough to cause the brain to move within the skull, such as shaken baby syndrome or high speed vehicle crashes. Injury can also occur, however, in situations not involving blunt force, including seizures, infections of the brain, heart attacks, aneurysms, toxic chemical exposure, drug overdoses, lung problems, and other ways that oxygen is denied to the brain. In many cases, a brain injury sustained as a result of one of these events will result in an increased need for support in one or more of the following areas: physical capacities (the way we move and manipulate things); behavioral and emotional capacities (the way we act, tolerate, and feel); and cognitive capacities (the way we think and process information).</p>  <p>A brain injury is different from many other disabilities because the onset can be traumatic and sudden. Individuals who sustain a brain injury often lose the ability to perform what they once considered to be the simplest of daily tasks. For others, they may not realize that they are having problems doing something they used to do until they actually try it. The damage can be permanent and irreversible, which makes prevention the very best defense against injury.</p>  </div>  <h2>Implications of the ADA for Individuals Who Have Sustained a Brain Injury</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. The term disability under the ADA is defined as:</p>  <ol>  <li>a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual,</li>  <li>a record of such an impairment or,</li>  <li>being regarded as having such an impairment.</li>  </ol>  <p>&ldquo;Substantially limits&rdquo; means that the person is unable to perform, or is significantly limited in the ability to perform, an activity as compared with an average person in the general population. &ldquo;Major life activities&rdquo; refers to functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working.</p>  <p>A brain injury does constitute a physical or mental impairment under the ADA. Whether it rises to the level of a disability, however, depends upon whether the impairment substantially limits one of the aforementioned major life activities. For example, an employee whose perception or information processing difficulties cause her to be unable to gain information from a staff meeting would likely have an ADA disability, especially if most employees would have little or no difficulty gaining relevant information from the meeting. By contrast, the inability to take excellent notes of a highly detailed, eight-hour technical discussion would not constitute a substantial impairment because the average person would also not be able to do this.</p>  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to \"reasonably accommodate\" a qualified individual with a disability. An individual is qualified if he or she can perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation. The employer then provides a reasonable accommodation for that qualified individual, which is defined as the modification or adjustment of a job, employment practice, or work environment that makes it possible for the individual with a disability to be employed. The law states that the employer needs to accommodate from the first contact with the person with the disability, during the application process, on the job, in training, on the work site, and when considering promotions and layoffs. If job duties change, new accommodations may need to be made.</p>  <p>The ADA does not require the employer to provide accommodation, however, if doing so would impose an undue hardship upon the business. If the cost of an accommodation would impose such a hardship and no funding is available from another source, an applicant or employee with a disability should be offered the option of paying for the portion of the cost that constitutes an undue hardship, or of providing the accommodation.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodating an Applicant or Employee who has Sustained a Brain Injury</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Identifying the essential job functions of every job at your company will assist you in determining whether or not an individual is quali fied for a job either applied for or held prior to injury. In cases of re-employment, involvement of the employer in the rehabilitation process is critical. Whenever the employee permits your involvement, you should help the rehabilitation team know exactly what that employee was like prior to injury, what her job entailed, and what essential job functions she will be required to perform upon returning to work.</p>  <h3>Employee Selection Process</h3>  <p>As in all applicant cases, your main priority, regardless of disability, should be to determine whether an applicant has the necessary skills, experience, education, or other background to successfully perform the essential functions of the job. Your first step is to determine the components involved in applying for, obtaining, and maintaining a job, and being promoted within your company. Once you have clearly identified the different human resource activities an applicant or employee must go through, you will be able to determine possible accommodations that may make the process more accessible for a wider variety of applicants and potential employees.</p>  <p>When you advertise an open position, make sure the required qualifications and application directions are stated clearly and concisely. This will assist an individual who may have cognitive support needs in processing the information, allowing him/her to make a clear decision as to whether or not s/he may minimally qualify for the job.</p>  <p>The first rule of thumb when attempting to determine ways to increase the accessibility of human resources policies and practices within your company and accommodate an individual who has sustained a brain injury is to recognize that not all brain injuries result in the same support needs.</p>  <p>For example, one individual may have no difficulty reading an application form, while another may have a vision problem resulting from his brain injury that affects his ability to read.</p>  <p>Another example would be a right-handed applicant with limited use of his/her right arm as a result of the brain injury. Some effective strategies to accommodate that individual include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Allowing the person to complete the application without time constraints;</li>  <li>Allowing the person to take the application home and have assistance filling it out;</li>  <li>Mailing the application to the candidate upon request;</li>  <li>Offering the services of someone in the office to assist in completing it.</li>  </ul>  <p>Some potentially effective human resources strategies to use when interviewing with an applicant who has sustained a brain injury include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Giving clear concise directions;</li>  <li>If an applicant has requested reasonable accommodation for the interview, asking if s/he has an aide or assistant who might make the interview process more comfortable and aid him/her in presenting his/her skills and qualifications for the job;</li>  <li>Following up spoken communications (e.g. phone calls, dialogues) with a more permanent record (e.g. letter, audiotape, e-mail) to assist a person who may have memory support needs;</li>  <li>Making sure your interviewing site is accessible to aid the individual who may have physical support needs resulting from his/her injury.</li>  </ul>  <p>When you are conducting an interview, be yourself. Disability does not mean inability.</p>  <p>Question the candidate with a disability about &nbsp;the same essential job functions as any other applicant. To increase your comfort level and accommodate the potential support needs of the applicant who has sustained a brain injury, be mindful of:</p>  <ul>  <li>Finding out support needs prior to the interview (a good time to ask is when setting up the interview, but this assumes that the applicant has disclosed that they have a disability and/or will need an accommodation for the interview);</li>  <li>Speaking clearly and concisely;</li>  <li>Repeating a statement that an applicant has told you is unclear or unintelligible;</li>  <li>Minimizing distractions in the room (e.g., phone calls, interruptions, etc.);</li>  <li>Doing a walk-through or a tour prior to the interview to make sure the locations involved in the interview are accessible;</li>  <li>Initially introducing only essential personnel or explaining that s/he will meet quite a few people and it may take some time to get to know them all;</li>  <li>When explaining tasks or jobs, breaking down each into steps that may be easier to remember or sequence;</li>  <li>Encouraging the applicant to take notes if desired;</li>  <li>Avoiding negatives during questioning (e.g. do you instead of don&rsquo;t you; would you instead of wouldn&rsquo;t you, etc.);</li>  <li>Presenting ideas concretely rather than abstractly;</li>  <li>Moving on to a new topic if the person seems to be getting frustrated and returning to the original topic later in the interview.</li>  </ul>  <p>(Remember, not all applicants will need these accommodations. Assuming the applicant has requested accommodations, ask the applicant what may assist him/her).</p>  </div>  <h2>Enhancing Productivity on the Job</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Why do we use a chair to reach dishes on a high shelf? Why do we use automatic pencil sharpeners? Why do we use ergonomically designed office chairs? Simply put, these adaptations make a task easier and may save time. These are examples of simple accommo&shy;dations we make to be more productive and ease our workload.</p>  <h2>Selecting an Accommodation</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The employee candidate who requests an accommodation has lived and perhaps worked while having the disability. He may already have identified what accommodations work best for him. Given that support needs are individualized based upon the severity of a brain injury, accommodations should similarly be catered to an individual&rsquo;s needs. The process of identifying and selecting an accommodation should involve a dialogue between the employee and the employer. The employer may be able to accommodate the employee using easily identified supports (low tech) or may provide more intensified and expensive supports (high tech).</p>  <p>An accommodation for an individual who has sustained a brain injury could potentially include a variety of support strategies such as: calendars, to-do lists, memory log books, audiotapes, or other electronic/computer reminders; wheelchair-accessible facilities; job sharing, more frequent breaks or other modifications to work schedules; job checklists and cues; timers; tools to assist the person in tracking while reading such as a ruler or piece of paper with a window cut in it; smaller job steps to improve sequencing; raised desks or tables to allow for a wheelchair; Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) if the person has difficulty with speech or hearing; electronic communication systems; ramps; handrails; computer keyboard guards; large phone or computer keypads; changes in lighting or office location to minimize distractions; review of progress on job assignments at designated points in the day or week; and established routines during the day and across days. There are also numerous other potential accommodations that an employer may provide depending on the individual\'s needs.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tips for On-The-Job Training</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>All employees, regardless of disability, need the same introduction and orientation to a job and the same initial training. Determining the learning style of any new employee is a good human resources practice that maximizes the benefits of in-services and training provided. Ask the employee whether s/he learns best from strictly verbal instruction, or a combination style involving hands-on, written, and verbal instruction.</p>  <p>Any new employee has her own unique way of setting up a work station or organizing job tasks and supplies. Allowing the employee with a brain injury this flexibility can promote increased performance as long as job quality and quantity is not negatively affected.</p>  <p>In some cases, individuals with more severe disabilities may be represented by a rehabilitation agency or employment program that provides specialized support and technical assistance to employers regarding the employment of people with disabilities. Although these services can benefit the employer, they should not take the place of internal training, orientation, in-services, and promotional strategies and techniques utilized by your company. The key to successful on-the-job training is integrating, investing, and involving the new employee to the greatest degree possible without stigmatizing that person.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This publication was written in 1994 by Thomas  Golden, and was updated in June, 2000, by  Stephanie Hanson, Ph.D., College of Health  Professions, University of Florida.

The ADA prohibits discrimination in all areas of the employment process, including the application process, testing, hiring, assignments, medical exams, promotions, layoffs, compensation, benefits, and leave time.&nbsp; As a civil rights law, it was designed to level the playing field in the em&shy;ployment arena &ndash; so that people would not be denied jobs, or the benefits thereof, on the basis of a disability.</p>  <p><strong>To Whom Does the ADA Apply? </strong><br /><br /></p>  <ul>  <li>Employers --The ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees.&nbsp; It also applies to employment agencies, labor organizations, and to local and county governments.</li>  <li>Applicants/Employees -- The ADA pro&shy;vides protection to a &ldquo;qualified individual with a disability.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a two-pronged test.&nbsp; An individual must be both disabled and qualified.</li>  </ul>  <p>An individual with a disability under the ADA is an individual with a physical or mental im&shy;pairment that substantially limits a major life activity.&nbsp; The major life activity can be, among other things, caring for oneself, walking, talking, communicating, thinking, sleeping, breathing, concentrating, or working.&nbsp; In ad&shy;dition, a major life activity includes the opera&shy;tion of a major bodily function, such as normal cell growth.&nbsp; A person may also have a dis&shy;ability if she has a record of an impairment or if others regard her as having an impairment.&nbsp; Thus, someone with a history of a cancer diag&shy;nosis may be protected under the ADA.<br /><br />If the impairment is episodic or in remission, it nevertheless constitutes a disability if it would substantially impact a major life activity when active.&nbsp; In determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting, mitigating measures such as the use of medications to alleviate or eliminate symptoms are not taken into ac&shy;count. &nbsp;<br /><br />To be entitled to protection, the individual must also be &ldquo;qualified.&rdquo;&nbsp; This means the individual must be able to perform the es&shy;sential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation.&nbsp; For example, if a receptionist is unable to speak on the tele&shy;phone because of a disability and no adaptive equipment is available, this person might not be able to perform the essential functions of the job.&nbsp; If a truck driver&rsquo;s disability prevents him or her from moving heavy materials from a loading dock to a truck, that person may not be a qualified individual unless a reasonable accommodation is available, because moving the heavy materials may be an essential func&shy;tion of the job.<br /><br />But, suppose the employee with cancer is in a sales position and can handle the telephone contacts, the individual appointments, all the paperwork and the computer work.&nbsp; How&shy;ever, this salesperson cannot move boxes of sales materials from her office to her car.&nbsp; This employee may still be a qualified individual with a disability.&nbsp; Another person could help move the boxes to her car as a reasonable ac&shy;commodation under the ADA, or moving the boxes may be a marginal function of the job.&nbsp; The employer should identify both the essen&shy;tial and marginal functions of a job so that one may determine whether an individual with a disability is qualified to perform those func&shy;tions deemed essential.<br /><br /></p>  </div>  <h2>How Can Reasonable Accommodations Work for Both the Employer and the Employee?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>If a person is a qualified individual with a disability, s/he is entitled to a reasonable ac&shy;commodation, unless it would be an undue hardship for the employer.&nbsp; Some examples of reasonable accommodations include a flexible schedule, a light duty position, an extended period of leave time, or reassignment to a vacant position.&nbsp; Under some court interpreta&shy;tions of the ADA, attendance at a job can be an essential function of the job; other courts have held, however, that an extended period of paid or unpaid leave time may be a reason&shy;able accommodation.&nbsp; Each situation must be assessed on an individualized basis, including whether the accommodation would impose an undue hardship upon the employer.<br /><br />The ADA does not specifically provide a list of reasonable accommodations&ndash; it is meant to be a dialogue between the individual and em&shy;ployer based upon the specific type of job and the nature, size, and resources of the company involved.&nbsp; Additionally, accommodations are only required for known disabilities of the individual&mdash;the employer must first be aware that an individual is seeking a reasonable ac&shy;commodation under the ADA.&nbsp; It is also gener&shy;ally up to the individual needing the accom&shy;modation to make suggestions to the employer about the type of reasonable accommodations s/he is requesting.<br /><br />Some sample accommodations that might be made for a person with cancer are:</p>  <ul>  <li>leave for doctors\' appointments and/or to seek or recuperate from treatment</li>  <li>periodic breaks or a private area to rest or to take medication</li>  <li>adjustments to a work schedule</li>  <li>permission to work at home</li>  <li>modification of office temperature</li>  <li>permission to use work telephone to call doctors</li>  <li>reallocation or redistribution of marginal tasks to another employee</li>  <li>reassignment to another job</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>What Else Does the ADA Govern?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>If a prospective employee is applying for a new job, s/he does not need to disclose her medical condition.&nbsp; S/he can ask for the rea&shy;sonable accommodation after s/he gets the job.&nbsp; If a person has a visible impairment, the pro&shy;spective employer can only ask the potential employee how s/he would perform the essen&shy;tial job functions, with or without a reasonable accommodation, and ask for a demonstration. &nbsp;<br /><br />If a person receives a conditional job offer based upon undergoing a medical examina&shy;tion, such an examination must be required of all employees in the same job category.&nbsp; The offer cannot be rescinded unless the medical examination indicates that the person cannot perform the essential functions of the job with or without a reasonable accommodation.<br /><br />Finally, any requests for reasonable accom&shy;modations under the ADA are to be kept confidential.&nbsp; The request and any information obtained from the individual in support of the request should be kept in a file that is kept separate and apart from an individual&rsquo;s per&shy;sonnel file.<br /><br /></p>  </div>  <h2>What Other Laws May Apply in the Workplace?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA works hand in hand with the Family and Medical Leave Act.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> The FMLA provides for a person to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave to care for a seriously ill spouse, parent or child, and up to 26 weeks if that family member is a service member who is recovering from a serious injury of illness incurred while on active duty. It also allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for a serious medical condition of the employee. Although unpaid (unless the employer requires use of or the employee opts to use available paid time off or sick leave), this is job-protected leave, which means the employee returns to the same or an equivalent position. This law also requires the employer to keep an employee&rsquo;s benefits intact and may not require the employee use COBRA to continue their benefits coverage.</p>  <p>The FMLA applies to employers with 50 or more employees. Covered employees must have been employed at least a year and have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in that year, though the 12 months do not have to be consecutive. Sometimes, a person will need leave for a period of time longer than that provided by the FMLA. In that case, a person may be able to take an extended period of leave as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA.</p>  <p>Additionally, state laws may provide protections equal to or greater than those under the ADA or FMLA. Each employer should review the applicable state laws to determine the employer and employee&rsquo;s rights and responsibilities under these laws.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup>29 U.S.C.A &sect;&sect;2601-2615 (2001).</div>  </div>  <h2>Working Together</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Cancer can be a life-altering experience, for the person with cancer and also for family, friends, employers, and co-workers.

The first section of the law, Title I, governs employment discrimination.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Does Title I Say About Employment?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Title I of the ADA provides that employers cannot discriminate against qualified applicants and employees with disabilities. A qualified individual with a disability is an individual who meets both the educational and experience requirements of a position held or desired and can perform the essential functions of the position with or without a reasonable accommodation. Providing a necessary reasonable accommodation is a key part of the ADA\'s nondiscrimination requirements.</p>  </div>  <h2>What is Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to the application process, a job, an employment practice, or the work environment that makes it possible for a qualified individual with a disability to participate in and enjoy an equal employment opportunity. The employer\'s obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation applies to all aspects of employment. The duty is ongoing and may arise any time a person\'s disability or job changes. An employment opportunity cannot be denied to a qualified applicant or employee because of the need to provide reasonable accommodation. However, the ADA does not require an employer to provide a reasonable accommodation that will impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business</p>  <p>An undue hardship means that an accommodation would be unduly costly, extensive, substantial or disruptive, or would fundamentally alter the nature or operation of the business. According to the ADA, if the cost of an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer, and no outside funding is available, the individual with a disability must be given the option of paying for the portion of the cost that causes the undue hardship or providing the accommodation. The employer and the employee should discuss what the employee\'s needs are and together determine an effective reasonable accommodation through an informal interactive process.</p>  </div>  <h2>Who is Likely to Need an Accommodation for a Cognitive Disability?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Cognitive disabilities are disabilities that affect a person\'s awareness; memory; and ability to learn, process information, communicate, and make decisions. They affect a person\'s cognition, that is, the act or process of knowing, including awareness and judgment. \"Cognition\" refers to \"understanding,\" the ability to comprehend what you see and hear, and to infer information from social cues and body language. People with these impairments may have trouble learning new things, making generalizations from one situation to another, and expressing themselves through spoken or written language. Cognitive limitations can arise at any age but those encountered in people of employable age are very likely to have existed since childhood; in this case the limitation may have affected life experience as well as school learning.</p>  <p>Cognitive limitations of varying degrees can often be found in people who have been classified in school as having a learning disability, mental retardation, autism, multiple disabilities, or who have been diagnosed as having traumatic brain injury. It is important, however, not to approach an individual with any preconceived notions as to his or her specific capabilities. Since the type of supports needed is highly individual, an employer should take time to get acquainted with the applicant or employee and structure job accommodations accordingly.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Considerations Might be Important in the Job Application and Interview Process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Individuals with cognitive disabilities may require help during the job application and interview process. Some easy accommodations to make during this process could include:</p>  <ul>  <li>using multiple formats to advertise job postings, such as newspaper and radio advertising.</li>  <li>simplifying and minimizing wording on the job application;</li>  <li>clarifying issues and assisting an individual in completing information required on the job application;</li>  <li>conducting a verbal interview to obtain job application information that may be more complex in nature and difficult to put in writing;</li>  <li>allowing others to help the applicant fill out the application;</li>  <li>describing job requirements clearly, concisely and simply, or showing the person the job;</li>  <li>adjusting length of interview to maximize applicant\'s ability to remain attentive and decrease stress levels; and</li>  <li>interviewing in a quiet, informal, distraction-free environment.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>What About Job Training and Performance Considerations?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Individuals with cognitive disabilities may have relevant work experience, but sometimes will require job training. In this case, the reasonable accommodation needed may be to have added assistance in job training. This type of accommodation could mean that the employer or supervisor:</p>  <ul>  <li>spends additional time in training the new employee;</li>  <li>breaks job tasks down into smaller steps that are more clearly defined;</li>  <li>use very clear and basic language to provide job instructions;</li>  <li>develops a set routine in a job;</li>  <li>develops a consistent work sequence;</li>  <li>allows the employee to use alarm watches or timers;</li>  <li>develops pictures or diagrams showing the job sequence to assist in learning tasks;</li>  <li>teaches the employee with the disability how to follow the example of co-workers to learn work routines and appropriate work behaviors;</li>  <li>encourages co-worker involvement in ongoing support, if needed; and</li>  <li>provides extended supervision.</li>  </ul>  <p>The employer should maintain an open relationship with the employee regarding performance and work behavior expectations. The employer or supervisor should take time to orient the employee to company rules as presented in the basic orientation training or company handbook. The employer must be sure the employee understands the expected quantity and quality of work and how that will be judged.</p>  <p>Another accommodation may involve job restructuring. The employer would reallocate or redistribute to others the job functions that an employee is unable to perform because of the cognitive disability. Job functions may also be exchanged among employees, so that the employee with a disability is assigned job functions that other employees may have performed. The result is a restructured job that accommodates the employee\'s disability. The employer does not have to eliminate an essential job function when restructuring a job. A person who cannot perform an essential function, a fundamental duty of the position, is not considered qualified for the job. However, an employer could modify when or how an essential function is performed. For example, allowing an employee to do paperwork in the morning when s/he is more rested rather than at the end of the day, or allowing the use of talking software instead of traditional word processing software.</p>  <p>The employer may also provide a reasonable accommodation by allowing an employee with a disability to work a modified or part-time schedule. An example of this is allowing an employee who depends on public transportation to adjust work arrival and departure times to coincide with the bus schedule. Another example is job sharing where two individuals with a disability each work half time to perform one full-time job.</p>  <p>Other accommodations include making existing facilities accessible, acquiring or modifying equipment used in the job, and, as a last resort, reassignment to a vacant position.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is Reasonable Accommodation Related to Benefits and Privileges of Employment?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA\'s mandate to accommodate includes all aspects of employment. The benefits and privileges of employment are those enjoyed by similarly situated employees without disabilities. Examples of benefits and privileges include training; services such as cafeterias, credit unions and transportation; and parties and other business-related social functions. The person with a cognitive disability may need assistance in fitting in with co-workers. The employee might need added assistance to be included in company social events, to participate in employer-sponsored training, and to be considered for job advancement and promotional opportunities.</p>  <p>Supports of this nature could include:</p>  <ul>  <li>developing a transportation network to aid the employee in attending social activities;</li>  <li>facilitating relationships with co-workers;</li>  <li>ensuring the employee with a disability has access to information communicated to all employees;</li>  <li>ensuring accessibility of training activities;</li>  <li>having the trainer adapt materials and instruction to meet the needs of employees with cognitive disabilities;</li>  <li>investigating other jobs for promotion potential; and</li>  <li>modifying a workplace policy to accommodate the employee\'s disability</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Are There Other Possible Considerations in Working with People with Cognitive Disabilities?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA encourages an informal, interactive, reasonable accommodation process, which starts with the employer and the person with the disability jointly exploring what the best accommodation might be to support the individual. In the case of a person with cognitive disabilities, it may be desirable to involve someone who can serve as an advocate and assist in communication, such as a job coach, family member, or rehabilitation counselor in this process. The potential employee should, to the maximum extent possible, be central in these discussions.</p>  <p>Individuals with cognitive disabilities who aspire to enter the job market generally have some sense of their own limitations. In fact, such a sense is usually a positive indicator of success; at the same time, the individual is likely to be sensitive to the stigma attached to his or her limitations and eager not to be identified as \"retarded\" or \"stupid.\" The initial encounter is therefore very important. Creating an atmosphere of acceptance and trust at the outset facilitates accessibility and is a good business practice.</p>  <p>While an individual with a cognitive disability may require support in the various areas discussed, it is important to check with the individual regarding the level of support that he or she may need. Other considerations may include:</p>  <ul>  <li>not speaking in so simple, loud, or basic a manner as to offend the individual;</li>  <li>assigning and matching jobs that appropriately challenge and engage the individual;</li>  <li>speaking directly to the individual regarding matters of concern;</li>  <li>encouraging natural social relationships with co-workers; and</li>  <li>when using adaptations, job modifications or other supports, making sure the individual with the disability is included in deciding which kinds of aids will be useful.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Where Can I Find Resources to Assist in the Accommodation Process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The local office of the state vocational rehabilitation agency and other community-based employment agencies for people with cognitive disabilities are possible resources for job coaches to assist the individual in the job application process, learning the tasks of the job, and sustaining and progressing in the job. Additional resources are listed below.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Susanne Bruyere, Ph.D., CRC &  Thomas Golden, Training Coordinator','Sharon Davis, Ph.D.',94,'Program on Employment and Disability  School of Industrial and Labor Relations  Cornell University','Director  Professional and Familiy Services  The Arc of the United States','January, 2001',NULL),(7,'Collective Bargaining','The ADA and Collective Bargaining Issues',3,'<h2>What is the Americans with Disabilities Act?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is to protect and guar&shy;antee access and participation for persons with disabilities in employment, pub&shy;lic accommodations, public services, transportation, and telecommunications. Title I of the ADA prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in all terms and conditions of employment, including recruitment, pre-employment screening, hiring, benefits, promotions, layoff and termination. Employers of 15 or more employees are subject to Title I of the ADA, as are labor organizations, employment agencies, and joint labor-management committees.</p>  <p>Under the ADA, an individual with a disability is a person who: has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impair&shy;ment. Courts determine whether an individual is substantially limited in per&shy;forming a major life activity by comparing the performance of the person in question to that of most people in the general population. The impairment need not prevent or severely limit an individual&rsquo;s major life activity in order to be con&shy;sidered &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; limiting. Also, the fact that an individual uses mitigating measures (such as medication or equipment, for example) to minimize the effects of the impairment has absolutely no bearing upon whether it substantially limits a major life activity. Under the ADA, an employer may not deny anyone the opportunity to apply for a job be&shy;cause of a request to reasonably accommodate his or her disability during the application process, nor may an employer deny an em&shy;ployment opportunity to a qualified employee with a disability because he or she needs a rea&shy;sonable accommodation in order to perform the job&rsquo;s essential functions. An employer is not required to provide any accommodation that would impose an undue hardship on it, however.</p>  <h2>How does the ADA affect Unionized Employers?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Private sector employers whose employees are represented by a union are subject to both the ADA and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Under the NLRA, the union is the exclusive representative of the employees, and an employer is prohibited from dealing direct&shy;ly with employees concerning the terms and conditions of employment. Furthermore, the NLRA prohibits an employer from implement&shy;ing any change in the terms and conditions of employment without offering the union an opportunity to bargain over the proposed changes.</p>  <p>The ADA prohibits employers and unions from entering into collective bargaining agree&shy;ments that discriminate against individuals protected by the ADA.</p>  <h2>What Obligations does a Union have under the ADA and the NLRA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The employment discrimination provisions of the ADA apply to unions as employers and as bargaining agents. Under the NLRA, a union has a duty of fair representation; that is, the union must act reasonably, in a non-discrimi&shy;natory fashion, and in good faith with respect to the employees it represents. This duty might require the union to assist an employee in requesting a reasonable accommodation and in working with the employer to deter&shy;mine the reasonable accommodations avail&shy;able to that employee.</p>  <h2>What is a &ldquo;Reasonable Accommodation&rdquo; under the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Under the ADA, the individual with a disabil&shy;ity and the employer engage in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable ac&shy;commodation exists. Once the individual with a disability requests an accommodation and the employer determines the essential func&shy;tions of the position at issue, the parties must then determine what limitation(s) the individ&shy;ual&rsquo;s disability impose on the job. The parties evaluate accommodations that would allow the individual to overcome job limitations and then select an effective and reasonable accom&shy;modation, if available. While the employee&rsquo;s preference is considered, the employer has the discretion to choose between equally effective reasonable accommodations. The individual with a disability may disclose medical information to the employer during the reasonable accommodation process. The ADA requires that employers keep medical information concerning job applicants and employees confidential and maintain it in files separate from personnel records. Persons involved in the reasonable accommodation process who have access to this type of infor&shy;mation have a continuing obligation to main&shy;tain its confidentiality.</p>  <h2>What is the Reasonable Accommodation Process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Under the ADA, the individual with a disabil&shy;ity and the employer engage in an interactive process to determine whether a reasonable ac&shy;commodation exists.

The Equal Employ&not;ment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency responsible for the enforcement of the ADA, has rejected the position that a reasonable accommodation imposes an undue hardship simply because it would violate a collective bargaining agreement. Rather the employer first should determine if it could provide a reasonable accommodation that would remove the workplace barrier without violating the collective bargaining agreement. If there is no such accommodation, then the employer and union should attempt to nego&not;tiate a variance to that part of the collective bargaining agreement that conflicts with a requested reasonable accommodation (such as a &ldquo;light duty&rdquo; assignment or a transfer to a position with different physical and mental requirements). An employer cannot use the existence of a collective bargaining agreement as its reason not to offer or implement a rea&not;sonable accommodation unless it can show that the request would have an adverse affect on the other employees in the bargaining unit. The greater that adverse affect, the more likely it is that the accommodation is not reasonable.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>The General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), the federal agency responsible for enforcement of the NLRA, has stated that for a reasonable accommodation that does not affect terms and conditions of employment (for instance, putting a desk on blocks, providing a ramp, Braille signage or providing an interpreter) an employer need not negotiate with the union representing its employees, and the employee could request the accommodations directly from its employer.</p>  <p>Employers would be required to negotiate with the union if the requested accommoda&not;tion would cause a material, substantial, or significant change in the terms and conditions of employment, such as requiring a change in the collective bargaining agreement itself. A proposed accommodation that would ad&not;versely affect the seniority rights of other em&not;ployees would not be reasonable, and there-fore, an employer and union refusing such an accommodation would not violate the ADA. The parties, the employer, the union, and the individual requesting the accommodation, however, would still be required to engage in the good faith interactive process to determine whether any other type of accommodation is available.</p>  <h2>What Proactive Approaches are Available to Employers and Unions to Meet the Requirements of the ADA and the NLRA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Employers and unions may be able to elimi&shy;nate or reduce the potential conflicts between the ADA and the NLRA through collaborative long-range planning. Employers and unions can create a cooperative environment with respect to their obligations under the ADA and the NLRA. At the outset, the employer and the union might review their collective bargaining agreement to ensure that individu&shy;als are not subject to disability discrimination. The employer and the union may also consid&shy;er including in the contract specific protections or safeguards for individuals with disabilities, procedures for the reasonable accommodation process, or a light duty program.</p>  <p>Employers and unions could also present edu&shy;cational programs on the ADA, such as open discussions on the effects of the ADA on the work environment by both management and union personnel.</p>  <p>A joint employer-union committee could be formed to discuss and consider ADA compli&shy;ance issues. The labor-management commit&shy;tee could consider requests for reasonable ac&shy;commodation and work with employees in the informal interactive process of determining a reasonable accommodation. The committee might also assist in the determination of essen&shy;tial job functions, review necessary accommo&shy;dations, and analyze what accommodations are available or possible within the context of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>  <h2>What Role Can the Shop Steward Play in Assisting Implementation of the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The union steward or business agent is the person in the union with whom each member may have direct contact &ndash; to whom members bring their problems and grievances, from whom members get information, and who has access to employees during the work day. The union can disseminate vital information about the ADA through the shop steward or business agent to its members, such as the illegality of discrimination against individuals with dis&shy;abilities and how the reasonable accommoda&shy;tion process works.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>These proactive approaches will serve both the employer and union with respect to their obli&shy;gations under the ADA, to provide reasonable accommodation, and under the NLRA, to bar&shy;gain where necessary over reasonable accom&shy;modations that effect changes in the terms and conditions of employment. Most of all, these proactive approaches will foster positive and productive work environments for employers and unions, and further the goal of the ADA, the inclusion and appreciation of persons with disabilities in the workplace and society.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This publication was written in 1997 and updated  in 2001 by Laurie M.

Nearly 24 million people in the United States have diabetes, which means that 7.8% of the United States population has the disease.</p>  <p>There are two major types of diabetes:</p>  <p>Type 1 (formerly known as &ldquo;juvenile diabetes&rdquo; or &ldquo;insulin-dependent diabetes&rdquo;) &ndash; a disease in which the body produces very little or no insulin, often first diagnosed in children and young adults. People with type 1 diabetes must receive insulin from an outside source (typically through injections or use of an insulin pump) to stay alive. Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5 to 10 percent of all cases of diabetes diagnosed in the United States.</p>  <p>In type 2 diabetes (formerly known as &ldquo;adult onset&rdquo; diabetes) the body retains the ability to make insulin, but cannot make enough to meet its needs because cells cannot recognize insulin or use it as effectively as in people without diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90 to 95 percent of diabetes cases in the United States. Some people with type 2 (particularly in the early stages of the disease) can control their diabetes through diet and exercise. Others must take various types of oral medications, while still others use insulin, much as those with type 1 do.</p>  <p>Diabetes causes blood glucose (sugar) levels to be too high. This is known as hyperglycemia. In the short term, high blood glucose levels can cause hunger, thirst, headache, blurry vision, frequent urination, itchy and dry skin, and, if it is not treated for a period of time, diabetic ketoacidosis, which can cause breathing difficulties, coma, and even death. Hyperglycemia is treated by taking insulin, which lowers blood glucose levels.</p>  <p>In the long term, high blood glucose levels can cause a number of serious complications such as eye disease (which can lead to blindness), kidney disease , nerve damage (neuropathy), heart attack, stroke, hypertension and foot problems that can lead to leg/foot amputations.</p>  <p>Insulin and oral medications do not cure diabetes. Moreover, insulin and some oral medications can cause blood glucose levels to go too low. This is known as hypoglycemia and can result in tremors, palpitations and sweating, confusion, drowsiness, mood changes, unresponsiveness, unconsciousness, convulsions, and death. Mild hypoglycemia is treated with a source of quick-acting sugar, such as hard candy or a glucose tablet. Severe hypoglycemia is treated with injections of a hormone called glucagon.</p>  <p>This does not mean that most people with diabetes, or even diabetes treated with insulin, will experience the most extreme symptoms of high and low blood glucose levels. It does mean that people with diabetes must use vigilance in order to keep their blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible in order to avoid a broad range of immediate and long-term medical problems.</p>  <p>Diabetes cannot be cured, but through diabetes self-management, people with diabetes adjust food, insulin and/or oral medication, and exercise in order to keep blood glucose levels within a prescribed range. The person with diabetes needs to take responsibility for maintaining a good diet, exercising, and seeking appropriate medical care. Those who take good care of themselves can be as productive or even more productive than other employees simply because they are knowledgeable about and participate in a healthy life-style.</p>  </div>  <h2>Diabetes and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA defines a person with a disability in three ways:</p>  <ul>  <li>An individual who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;</li>  <li>Someone who has a record of such an impairment; or</li>  <li>Someone who is regarded as having such an impairment.</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Under regulations issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (implementing amendments to the ADA), diabetes is listed as a condition that will consistently be found to be a disability covered under the ADA. This is because, as the agency&rsquo;s regulations conclude, diabetes substantially limits major life activities such as functions of the endocrine system.</p>  <p>Diabetes is not well known or understood by many employers. The vast majority of people with diabetes live and work successfully without negative impact on their work. Because their condition does not impact their ability to do their job, they may choose to not make their employer aware of their condition. Fear of discrimination keeps many employees with diabetes quiet.</p>  <p><em>In what areas might employers discriminate?</em></p>  <p>As with any disability, the potential to discriminate exists at any point in the employment process.</p>  <p>Examples:</p>  <ul>  <li>A nurse sent her resume to 16 institutions that advertised job openings for which she was well-qualified and in her cover letter mentioned her diabetes. She had only two responses, and no job offer.</li>  <li>A man with diabetes initially hired to run a shipboard boutique was rejected by the company doctor; the doctor assumed, without reviewing the man&rsquo;s medical records or examining him, that he posed an unacceptable safety risk.</li>  <li>An airline employee was forced to take one 20-minute break rather than the two 10-minute breaks she needed to test her blood glucose, take insulin, and/or eat.</li>  <li>A cashier with diabetic neuropathy was unable to do his job because the employer would not allow him to sit down between customers, even though standing was not an essential job function.</li>  <li>A person with diabetes was rejected for the position of police officer because the municipal police department had a blanket policy that disqualified anyone who uses insulin &ndash; even though the applicant had informed the department that he had successfully held a law enforcement position in another county for a number of years and had maintained excellent control of his blood glucose levels throughout this period to the present.</li>  </ul>  <p>These situations reflect the fear and misunderstanding surrounding this condition. As with any other disability, the ADA requires employers to focus upon actual, and not perceived, limitations of the disease.</p>  </div>  <h2>Workplace Implications of Diabetes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Despite good monitoring of diet, medication, and exercise, some people with diabetes may experience hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. However, most people with diabetes recognize the warning signals of these conditions and immediately take appropriate action to bring their blood glucose level back to a safe range.</p>  <p>It is important that employers make the reasonable accommodations that allow people with diabetes to check their blood glucose level by self-administering a finger stick test (which takes less than a minute) and then administering medication (for high glucose levels) or a source of sugar (for low glucose levels). It only takes a few minutes for the person&rsquo;s blood glucose to return to normal.</p>  <p>The risk of hypoglycemia generally does not create a danger in the workplace. Thus, for example, there is no reason to disqualify a person from a desk job simply because he or she experiences even extreme hypoglycemia.</p>  <p>Even in those jobs where severe hypoglycemia could create a danger (for example, law enforcement positions) there is no reason to disqualify a person simply because he or she has diabetes or uses insulin. Rather, both the current state of diabetes management and judicial interpretations of the ADA have stressed that each person should be evaluated individually. The American Diabetes Association has stated, \"Employment decisions should not be based on generalizations or stereotypes regarding the effects of diabetes. The impact of diabetes and its management varies widely among individuals. Therefore, a proper assessment of individual candidates for employment or current employees must take this variability into account.&rdquo;</p>  </div>  <h2>What Types of Jobs Do People with Diabetes Do?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>There are very few restrictions for people with diabetes. Employers should not assume that diabetes will increase safety concerns. An employer may not deny an employment opportunity to a worker with diabetes based on safety concerns, unless it can demonstrate that the specific applicant or employee would pose a \"direct threat\" or significant risk of substantial harm to himself or herself or others that cannot be reduced or eliminated through reasonable accommodation. This assessment must be based on objective, factual evidence, including the best recent medical evidence and advances to treat and control diabetes. In addition, individuals should be assessed for their present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job, not based upon the possibility of future complications.</p>  <p>Problems may occur with those who cannot avoid severe hypoglycemia, and consequently they may not be able to work in safety-sensitive jobs. However, since this is quite uncommon, the employee, based on his or her experiences, should generally make this decision, not the employer, unless the employer can show that the specific employee presents a direct threat to workplace health or safety. Diabetes is a highly individualized condition. Ideally the employee, his or her doctor, and the employer will work together to ensure success.</p>  </div>  <h2>Reasonably Accommodating a Person who has Diabetes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>For the most part, people with diabetes should need no special treatment from their supervisors. An understanding of the condition and the possible need for regular work schedules and meal breaks is usually helpful and appreciated. Living successfully with diabetes means that a person must be self-disciplined, self-aware, and self-responsible, all valued characteristics in many jobs.</p>  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to \"reasonably accommodate\" the limitations imposed by a person&rsquo;s physical or mental disability. Reasonable accommodation is defined as modification or adjustment of a job, employment practice, or the work environment that makes it possible for a qualified person with a disability to be employed. The law states that the employer needs to accommodate during the first contact with the person with the disability, during the application process, on the job, in training, on the work site, and when considering promotions and layoffs. If job duties change, new accommodations may need to be made.</p>  <p>The ADA requires an employer to accommodate unless doing so would cause the employer an undue hardship. If an employer finds that the cost of an accommodation would impose an undue hardship, and no funding is available from another source, an applicant or employee with a disability should be offered the option of paying for the portion of the cost that constitutes an undue hardship, or of providing the accommodation.</p>  <p>If we think of accommodations as \"productivity enhancements\" similar to others made in the workplace, they become part of the cost of doing business.</p>  <p>The ADA requires that employers only accommodate known disabilities. The most common accommodation that a person with diabetes needs is easy and virtually cost-free: the time and space to check blood glucose levels and to self-administer medication or food. Schedules should be arranged to accommodate this. A private place to test and a place to store diabetes care supplies should be available if the employee desires it, as well. The employee may also need to test on an as-needed basis, when he or she can tell blood glucose levels are starting to rise or fall.</p>  <p>Individuals with diabetes may need access to food and/or beverages during the workday. For example, the employee may need to eat a snack to treat low blood glucose or drink water in order to keep hydrated. Employees should be permitted to eat or drink at their desk or work station where possible.</p>  <p>Employees may need leave or a flexible work schedule due to medical appointments or other diabetes care needs. Occasionally, employees may need to miss work due to the effects of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia or illness. Also, certain work schedules, such as rotating or split shifts, can make it especially difficult for some individuals to manage their diabetes, and may need to be modified.</p>  <p>Some people with diabetes do experience complications such as vision loss, nerve damage, or amputation that may require additional accommodations.</p>  <p>If the diabetes has resulted in visual loss, accommodations can be made. Low vision aids may prove useful. The employee&rsquo;s eye care professional may suggest magnification, appropriate lighting, or large print materials. The employee may want to contact a local resource center for people who are blind or visually impaired for a low vision assessment on the job to find useful aids.</p>  <p>Other people may develop complications such as neuropathy or amputation that make walking difficult. These conditions can often be accommodated by such easy actions as allowing an employee to sit while working or to limit walking by having a close parking spot or permitting shortcuts through the facility.</p>  </div>  <h2>Training and Promotion</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>For most people with diabetes, the employer should have no concerns about training and promotion. If the employee&rsquo;s diabetes has caused significant functional limitations, and if training activities are planned, consult the employee about possible accommodations needed in the training environment.</p>  <p>These may include:</p>  <ul>  <li>regular testing of blood glucose levels and meal breaks, just as during the normal work day</li>  <li>training materials put into alternative formats such as large print</li>  <li>having another trainee copy his or her notes if training is conducted in a darkened room</li>  </ul>  <p>Employers should assume that people with diabetes have the same career goals and aspirations as any other employee. A person&rsquo;s diabetes should play no part in decisions about transfers and promotions. Rather, employers should concentrate only on the appropriateness of the person&rsquo;s skills for a new position and determine if reasonable accommodations are needed. By capitalizing on a person\'s strengths and accommodating limitations, employers can maximize the productivity of their employees.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'It was extenstively revised and updated in  2001 by Shereen Arent, National Director of  Legal Advocacy, American Diabetes Association  from the original, which was written in  1993 by Mary B. Dickson. It was reviewed  for accuracy and timeliness in 2009 by Brian  Dimick, Associate Director, Government Affairs  and Advocacy, American Diabetes Association.',NULL,1,'Mary B. Dickson','Shereen Arent',99,'','National Director of Legal Advocacy  American Diabetes Association','1993','2001'),(9,'Diversity','Diversity and the ADA',2,'<h2>What is Diversity in the Workplace?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Broadly defined, workplace diversity is the understanding, valuing, and effective management of the ethnic, socio-economic, and gender variety or diversity with&shy;in an organization&rsquo;s workforce and among its customers. Many companies have recognized the importance of addressing the issue of diversity and are moving forward to establish and develop successful diversity initiatives. A primary cata&shy;lyst causing workplace diversity is the demographic shift of the U.S. population and, therefore, of the U.S. workforce.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Demographic studies show that the composition of the population in the U.S. is more diverse than it has ever been, and it continues to diversify. According to the Census Bureau, the nonwhite population, which comprised less than one-third of the U.S. population at the turn of the century, is expected to increase to nearly half of the U.S. population by the year 2050. As the number of persons with disabilities grows, so too does the number of persons of color living with a disability. According to the 2000 census, 16.8 million people with disabilities are also minorities. Minority persons with disabilities are disproportionately repre&shy;sented among the unemployed, and the employment outlook for them is bleak.</p>  <p>Given these changes in the population and in the labor market, there is an in&shy;creased reliance on non-traditional workers and the opportunity for organiza&shy;tions and individuals to capitalize on the array of ideas, creativity, and potential contributions inherent in a diverse workforce. Attracting, recruiting, developing, and retain&shy;ing a qualified workforce from diverse popu&shy;lations is, and will continue to be, critical for business survival and organizational success.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is the Americans with Disabilities Act?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), passed in 1990, is legislation that is intended to &ldquo;establish a clear and comprehensive prohi&shy;bition of discrimination on the basis of dis&shy;ability&rdquo; and to ensure access and participation in society for persons with disabilities. The statute is specifically directed at employment, public accommodations, public services (i.e., services delivered by state and local govern&shy;ments), transportation, and telecommunica&shy;tions. Title I of the ADA prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from discriminat&shy;ing against qualified persons with disabilities in all terms, conditions, and privileges of em&shy;ployment, including recruitment, pre-employ&shy;ment screening, hiring, benefits, promotions, layoff, and termination. The ADA also applies to labor organizations, employment agencies, and joint-management committees.</p>  <p>The ADA requires employers to provide rea&shy;sonable accommodations to qualified per&shy;sons with disabilities that will enable them to perform the essential functions of jobs held or desired. An employer may not deny an em&shy;ployment opportunity to a qualified applicant or employee with a disability because of a request or need for a reasonable accommoda&shy;tion. An employer does not have to provide an accommodation if it can demonstrate that it would impose an undue hardship on its busi&shy;ness.</p>  </div>  <h2>Addressing Diversity and the ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The term diversity can encompass several di&shy;mensions, such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, and disability. Di&shy;versity, disability, and human resource profes&shy;sionals need to be aware of these dimensions when helping their companies recruit and retain employees, sell in the marketplace, and define diversity within their organizations. Persons with disabilities, including minority persons with disabilities, have the ability to make positive contributions in the workplace and to the success of organizations.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Today, diversity initiatives are less &ldquo;affirma&shy;tive action&rdquo;-oriented in that they now reflect both valuing diversity and managing diversity. Valuing diversity involves recognizing and appreciating the differences of individuals. Managing diversity emphasizes developing company policies, goals, and a culture that optimizes the productivity of all employees, by understanding their unique needs, motiva&shy;tions, and contributions. Also, model initia&shy;tives have revealed that diversity initiatives require the visible support of and commitment from senior management.</p>  <p>Successful diversity initiatives can include an array of programs. Generally included is some form of training, as well as efforts to change the communication norms of the organization. Specifically, employee surveys, employee networks, diversity management training, mentoring programs, and the use of company intranets are frequently put in place to assess and broaden the attitudes of employ&shy;ees and management. Many corporations also examine their reward systems to ensure that employees are not being evaluated on their personal style, but rather on the merits of their work. As a part of the initiative, flexibility is sometimes incorporated into the work sched&shy;ule.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Employers are also making strides in assuring compliance with ADA employment provisions in their work environments. This may mean training staff on the following topics relating to ADA implementation:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Employment pre-screening and applicant interviewing under the ADA</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; The interplay of the ADA with other state and federal employment and non-discrim&shy;ination laws</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Writing job descriptions that clearly iden&shy;tify essential job functions</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; The reasonable accommodation process</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Career equity/promotional considerations for persons with disabilities</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Non-discriminatory performance apprais&shy;als</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Employee relations with employees with disabilities (minority and non-minority)</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Customer relations with customers with disabilities</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Negotiation/conflict management in the reasonable accommodation process</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">In summary, the implications for employers of addressing and understanding diversity and disability as related considerations include:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Enhanced recruitment and retention ef&shy;forts</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Improved productivity</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Expanded training programs that include both diversity (ethnicity, gender, and reli&shy;gion) and disabilities</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Expanded policies and programs</p>  <p>&bull; Improved morale</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p><strong>Reasonable accommodation </strong>is any modifica&shy;tion of or adjustment to a job, an employment practice, or the work environment that makes it possible for a qualified individual with a dis&shy;ability to apply for and perform the essential functions of a job.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Reasonable accommodation includes, but is not limited to, modification or adjustment of the application process to enable individu&shy;als with disabilities to apply for work, mak&shy;ing facilities readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities, modifying work schedules, reallocation of non-essential job functions, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, and reassignment to a vacant position. An employer is not required to reallocate essential job functions or to create &ldquo;light-duty&rdquo; positions.</p>  <p>An employer is not required to provide a rea&shy;sonable accommodation if it can demonstrate that it would be an undue hardship to do so. Whether a reasonable accommodation creates an <strong>undue hardship </strong>is a factual issue depend&shy;ing on factors such as the nature and net cost of the accommodation and the size and nature of the business. The duty of reasonable ac&shy;commodation is situation-specific.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is The Reasonable Accommodation Process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>To identify a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, the employer and employee may wish to engage in a flexible interactive discussion. Generally, if an individual with a disability wants a reasonable accommodation, he or she must request one. If the employer has already not done so, it should then deter&shy;mine the essential functions of the affected job and consult with the applicant or employee to determine the job-related limitations imposed by his or her disability. The parties should evaluate possible accommodations and select one that allows the employee to overcome the identified job limitations. While the em&shy;ployee\'s preference is given consideration, the employer has the discretion to choose between equally effective reasonable accommodations.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">It is important that the concepts of non-dis&shy;crimination and equal access for all persons with disabilities be part of an ongoing discus&shy;sion in the workplace. Making an accommoda&shy;tion that meets an individual\'s specific needs is less difficult when organizations foster a climate that supports ADA compliance. For example, when a person has difficulty per&shy;forming a nonessential job function and the employer accommodates that employee by reallocating the task, such a reallocation is usually easier when employees are prepared through prior training and ongoing group dialogue on accommodation issues.</p>  <p>The ADA contains strict confidentiality re&shy;quirements pertaining to medical information obtained during a medical examination or inquiry. Medical information must be collect&shy;ed and maintained on separate forms and in separate medical files and be kept confidential. There are certain narrow circumstances when such information may be disclosed, including informing supervisors and managers about necessary work restrictions or accommoda&shy;tions.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are some suggested strategies for heightening awareness of workplace diversity considerations, multicultural persons with disabilities, and the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Successful implementation of both diversity and ADA initiatives require efforts to change corporate culture and attitudes. Both suggest the need for staff training on non-discrimina&shy;tion practices, diversity awareness, diversity skills, flexibility in work schedules, and inves&shy;tigation of employee evaluation and reward structures. The parallel nature of these strate&shy;gies suggests that the combination of disability and diversity initiatives is possible and would likely be advantageous to the success of both efforts.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Selected strategies that may both further di&shy;versity initiatives and implementation of the ADA include:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Diversity initiatives that include active recruitment and retention of individuals of all backgrounds with disabilities in the workplace through collaborative agree&shy;ments with state Vocational Rehabilitation agencies or local job placement services for individuals with disabilities.</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Development of targeted job programs for minorities with disabilities</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Development of a mentoring program for people with disabilities</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Making training, development, and pro&shy;motional opportunities available to all minorities seeking job advancement. For individuals of all backgrounds with dis&shy;abilities, this may include supplying needed supports to enable them to access training, considering new positions, or acquiring needed retraining when a dis&shy;ability occurs that prevents a return to the original job position.</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Integration of the nondiscrimination requirements of the ADA and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for persons with dis&shy;abilities in all facets of staff training and human resources practices.</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; Making an organizational commitment to diversity by designating an organizational official to serve as a disability and diver&shy;sity specialist.</p>  <p>These are only a few of many proactive ini&shy;tiatives that employers can take to recruit and retain individuals with disabilities in the workplace, thereby expanding their potential labor pool and maximizing human resources to enhance workplace outcomes.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'It has been updated by Laura Herzog, Director, EEO/Diversity & Inclusion Programs, Cornell University ILR School, from the origi nal, which was written in 1996 by Susanne M. Bruyère.  ',NULL,1,'Susanne Bruyere, Ph.D., CRC, SPHR','Laura Herzog',88,'Director  Program on Employment and Disability  School of Industrial and Labor Relations  Cornell University','Director, EEO/Diversity & Inclusion Programs, Cornell University ILR School','1996','2010'),(10,'Epilepsy','Working Effectively with Employees who Have Epilepsy',4,'<h2>What is Epilepsy?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The word &ldquo;epilepsy&rdquo; derives from the Greek word &ldquo;to be seized.&rdquo; It is a ge&shy;neric term that refers to a wide variety of seizure conditions. There are very well known individuals in history such as Julius Caesar, Socrates, Vincent van Gogh, Dostoyevsky, and others who had active seizure conditions, as do a num&shy;ber of present day celebrities, sports figures, and political figures (e.g., Margaux Hemingway, Buddy Bell, Tony Coelho). These individuals were or are quite obviously very productive persons contributing significantly to society.</p>  <p>A seizure involves a disruption of the normal activity of the brain through neuro&shy;nal instability. Neurons become unstable and fire in an abnormally rapid man&shy;ner, similar to a misfiring engine, with the excess electric discharges resulting in a seizure. The seizure may be confined to one area of the brain (partial seizure) or take place throughout the entire brain (generalized seizure). The most com&shy;mon generalized seizure, formerly known as a &ldquo;grand mal&rdquo; seizure (now known as a tonic clonic seizure), is often easier to control than a partial seizure. A major&shy;ity of the individuals coming to specialized epilepsy centers for treatment have partial seizures, which can be more difficult to control, but usually are function&shy;ally safer. The causes of epilepsy are wide ranging and include infectious diseas&shy;es in a pregnant mother, parasitic infections, vascular diseases, and birth trauma. Only 1&ndash;2% of conditions can be traced to genetic causes. It must be remembered that epilepsy involves recurring or more than one seizure for various medical reasons, any number of individuals may experience a single seizure. There are 200,000 new cases of epilepsy diag&shy;nosed each year and the prevalence of active epilepsy is estimated as almost 3 million in the United States. Establishing a seizure diagnosis involves the taking of a medical history and an evaluation by a neurologist, and generally, an awake and/or sleep electroencephalograph (EEG) assessment. It is important to note that precise seizure diagnosis can involve not only both types of EEGs, but also magnetic reso&shy;nance imaging (MRI), computerized tomogra&shy;phy (CT) scanning, or even 24 hour EEG video monitoring. The MRI can now be the first step in diagnostic sequence, preceding EEG.</p>  <p>Many individuals with the correct diagnosis and medication can easily manage their epi&shy;lepsy. The vast majority of individuals with epilepsy experience complete freedom from seizures or good seizure control. Individu&shy;als with recurring seizures should always be referred to a neurologist. If a neurologist cannot achieve seizure control with an indi&shy;vidual over a nine-month period, referral to a specialized epilepsy center should be made. During the 1990s, a number of new medica&shy;tions, including Gabepentin, Lamotrogine, and Topiramate, were developed. In addition to anticonvulsant medications, some individuals benefit dramatically from use of a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS), which is an implant that can help people for whom medications have not been effective. Some people are also candi&shy;dates for epilepsy surgery, which can provide seizure freedom or improved control.</p>  <h2>First Aid for Seizures</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Since the majority of individuals with epilepsy have partial seizures, which typically involve a short period of disorientation (e.g., 30 seconds) or brief cessation of activity; first aid concerns are minimal. These individuals simply need to be watched during the period of seizure, or gently guided (not restrained) to a chair with reassuring statements. For individuals who have a generalized tonic clonic or grand mal seizure involving loss of consciousness, a pe&shy;riod of rigidity, and convulsions, the most im&shy;portant first aid concern is that the seizure be timed. Emergency medical aid is not required unless the seizure length approaches five min&shy;utes. Most of these seizures last slightly over a minute. Most persons will require some time in order to orient and compose themselves post seizure. When possible, they should be turned on their sides for comfort and any harmful items moved out of the way. Con&shy;trary to popular belief, it is not necessary, and may in fact be dangerous, to attempt to place something in the mouth of a person during a seizure.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Is Epilepsy Really a Concern at the Work Place For Those With an Active Condition?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>For those with active epilepsy, seizure condi&shy;tions can vary widely and need to be consid&shy;ered on an individual basis. Many individuals experiencing seizures will present absolutely no job relevant concerns. This includes indi&shy;viduals who have seizures only nocturnally, who have a consistent warning aura that al&shy;lows them to take safety precautions prior to the seizure, or who have only a partial seizure in which, for example, they do not lose con&shy;sciousness and experience only a limb tremor.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Many individuals with epilepsy will simply not discuss their condition because of their freedom from seizures, a high level of seizure control, or the fact that it does not impact per&shy;formance of the essential functions of the job (e.g., a person with nocturnal seizures only). Some individuals with epilepsy will prefer to discuss their disability at the end of the inter&shy;view as a matter of personal comfort or cour&shy;tesy to the employer even if it is not required. However, they may need to discuss their condition if drug testing is a standard part of the employment screening process once a job offer is extended. The presence of anticonvul&shy;sant drugs can be misinterpreted during drug testing.</p>  <h2>Implications of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) for Individuals with Epilepsy</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. The definition of physical impairment includes physiological disorders or conditions. Seizure disorders therefore qualify as a physical impairment under the ADA.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In determining whether such an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, medi&shy;cations and any other mitigating measures are not considered. Thus, if an individual&rsquo;s epi&shy;lepsy is completely or substantially controlled with medication, s/he could nevertheless qual&shy;ify as an individual with a disability entitled to ADA protections. Furthermore, as long as a person&rsquo;s epilepsy substantially limits a major life activity when active, the episodic nature of the seizures will not prevent that impairment from being classified as a disability.</p>  <h2>A General Perspective on Employer Concerns in the Work Place for Employees with Epilepsy</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Employers sometimes have a number of unfounded concerns about the work perfor&not;mance of individuals with epilepsy; some of the information below may be helpful:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>&bull; Attendance and performance - Most stud&not;ies suggest attendance and performance records for those with epilepsy are equal to or better than the general working popula&not;tion (McLellan, 1987).</p>  <p>&bull; Accident rates - Risch (1968) demonstrated that actual time lost due to seizures was approximately one hour for every thou&not;sand hours worked for individuals with active seizure conditions. Sands (1961) reviewed workers&rsquo; compensation cases over a 13-year period in the state of New York and established that accidents caused by sneezing or coughing on the job were twice as frequent than those related to seizure occurrences. Quattrini et al. (1999) indicate no change in job accident rate after the onset of epilepsy for 860 workers.</p>  <p>&bull; Working around machinery - In consider&not;ation of today&rsquo;s safety standards, it is rare that machinery would require any special modification for individuals with a seizure condition. Plastic guards, cut off mecha&not;nisms on machinery, and other safety modifications, are becoming standard.</p>  <p>&bull; Insurance rates - Hiring individuals with epilepsy does not increase a company&rsquo;s industrial insurance rates. These rates are linked to the hazards of specific occupa&not;tional classifications. EPI-HAB, a sheltered work system for those seizure disorders, reported receiving significant insurance premium reductions due to outstanding safety records. Health insurance providers generally link rates to age and sex in larger companies, while among smaller com&not;panies, the providers usually pool claim experiences and no one employer is penal&not;ized.</p>  <p>&bull; People with epilepsy generally refrain from drinking alcohol or engaging in rec&not;reational drug activity, and otherwise lead a relatively healthy lifestyle in order not to aggravate their condition. Consequently, they are often safer on the job than the average employee and are highly stable employees.</p>  <h2>Accommodation Issues for the Individual with Epilepsy</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>During the application and interview process, reasonable accommodations are generally not necessary for an individual with epilepsy. In the interview, however, some individuals may indicate that they need a specific type of ac&shy;commodation in order to perform the essential functions of a job or to perform those func&shy;tions more safely.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>As an employer, you should identify the es&shy;sential functions of a job that an individual is required to do at your work place with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>Although a number of companies routinely require a driver&rsquo;s license, this requirement is often not linked to an essential function of a job. A company may need to examine whether the capacity for driving is actually an essential job function and, if not, whether a job could be slightly modified or restructured so that a minimal amount of driving is performed by another worker or shared by other workers. Many individuals with epilepsy, however, are very capable of driving due to their level of seizure control, type of seizure warning, and other considerations. To drive, people with this disability are generally required to have a seizure free period of three months to a year. In some states, this is at the discretion of the individual&rsquo;s physician and his or her assess&shy;ment of an individual&rsquo;s seizure condition. In sum, driving can be an essential job function for some positions, such as a traveling sales representative or courier, but in any number of other cases driving is often a marginal and non essential job function.</p>  <p>In addition to restructuring job tasks, other examples of accommodation for individuals with epilepsy would include:</p>  <p>&bull; Installing a safety guard on a piece of ma&shy;chinery.</p>  <p>&bull; Installing some industrial rubber matting or carpeting in order to cover a concrete floor in a work area.</p>  <p>&bull; Scheduling consistent day work shifts for individuals whose seizures are exacer&shy;bated by inconsistent sleep patterns caused by rotating shifts and, in some cases, night shifts.</p>  <p>&bull; Allowing individuals to have an extended break or some time off after they have ex&shy;perienced a seizure while on the job.</p>  <p>&bull; Providing flame-retardant clothing for individuals working in an area in which a burn could be incurred during a seizure event and period of disorientation.</p>  <p>&bull; Provision of some type of safety helmet while on the job.</p>  <p>When they are needed, accommodations for individuals with epilepsy generally are not costly. The Job Accommodation Network (JAN), a service of the U.S. Department of Labor, Office of Disability Employment policy, and headquartered at West Virginia Univer&shy;sity, indicates that 56% of all accommodations cost nothing, while the remainder typically cost approximately $600. Accommodations for individuals with epilepsy frequently in&shy;volve a type of procedural consideration rather than physical changes to the worksite or purchase of equipment. This generally does not require any significant cost, nor is it likely to impose an undue hardship to the employer. Employees with epilepsy, particularly with a reasonable accommodation in place, will rarely pose a direct threat of harm in the work&shy;place.</p>  <h2>Selecting an Accommodation</h2>  <div class=\"section\">The selection of a reasonable accommoda&shy;tion can often be accomplished through direct dialogue between the employee and the em&shy;ployer. Accommodations can involve proce&shy;dural changes, which change how the job is done but do not involve assistive equipment or physical modifications to the worksite. They can also involve physical modifications or safeguards to a workstation, or low tech or high tech assistive equipment. Again, most of the considerations for those with epilepsy will involve a procedural change or perhaps some safeguarding of a workstation.  <p>If the employer and employee cannot agree on an effective reasonable accommodation, a state vocational rehabilitation agency, a lo&shy;cal Epilepsy Foundation affiliate, the national Epilepsy Foundation, or resources such as the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) can be contacted for assistance. State vocational reha&shy;bilitation agencies will often send a vocational rehabilitation counselor or assistive technolo&shy;gist to the job site in order to help with reason&shy;able accommodation needs. Again, it must be underscored that accommodation concerns for employees with epilepsy, when necessary, are generally very low cost. Individual companies may also be eligible to receive tax credits or deductions for physical modification or equip&shy;ment purchase efforts at the work site if this cost is not borne by a local or state vocational rehabilitation agency.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'It was written in January, 2001 and updated in  2010 by Robert F.

The ADA protects against disability-based discrimina&shy;tion in employment, governmental and commercial activities, transportation, and telecommunications.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What disabilities are covered by the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>For purposes of the ADA, a disability is a physical or mental impairment&mdash;for example, a visual impairment, HIV disease, or mental retardation &ndash; that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The ADA definition of major life activities includes not only activities such as walking, seeing, breathing, learning, bending, sleeping, and thinking, but also the operation of major bodily functions like the endocrine, respiratory, or circulatory systems.</p>  </div>  <h2>How does the ADA apply to employment?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Employers covered by the ADA may not discriminate against &ldquo;a qualified individual with a disability,&rdquo; - that is, an individual with a disability who meets the necessary prerequisites for a job and can perform the essential job functions with (or without) reasonable accommodation. ADA Title I applies to employers, including employment agencies, labor unions, and joint labor-management committees, with at least fifteen employees. Title I prohibits both purposeful discrimination in employment and practices with discriminatory impact related to job application procedures, hiring, advancement, discharge, compensation, training, and other terms, conditions and privileges of employment. Criteria that have the effect of excluding individuals with disabilities from employment opportunities may not be used unless the criteria are job-related and are justified by business necessity. Title I also establishes the obligation for a covered entity to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a disability, except in the case of undue hardship.</p>  </div>  <h2>May health benefit costs influence employment decisions?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No. Personnel decisions regarding an individual with a disability may not be based upon whether, or to what extent, the individual is or would be covered under a health benefit plan. Employers may not fire or refuse to hire a qualified applicant who has a disability, or who has a dependent with a disability, in order to avoid potential increases in health insurance costs.</p>  </div>  <h2>Does the ADA apply to Health Benefit Plans?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Yes. In its 1993 Interim Enforcement Guidance, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) described how the ADA applies to health benefit plans.</p>  <p>First, the ADA requires employers to provide all employees - with a disability or without a disability - the same health insurance benefits. In other words, employers must accord employees with disabilities equal access to whatever health insurance they provide to em-ployees without disabilities. However, eligibility for health benefits need not be extended to employees with disabilities if such benefits are not extended to nondisabled employees in similar circumstances, e.g., part-time employees.</p>  <p>In addition, the ADA prohibits employers from participating in any contractual arrangement that subjects the employer&rsquo;s applicants or employees to discrimination on the basis of disability. This prohibition includes any third-party provider of health insurance whose health benefit plan fails to accord individuals with disabilities equal access to health insurance.</p>  </div>  <h2>What coverage classifications does the ADA permit?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>ADA Title V allows bona fide insured or self-insured employee benefit plans to make some health-related distinctions for risk classifications based upon, or not inconsistent with, state law. However, this &ldquo;insurance exemption&rdquo; may not be used as a &ldquo;subterfuge&rdquo; to evade the purposes of the ADA. According to the EEOC, health insurance distinctions that are not disability-based do not violate the ADA, even if they have a disproportionate impact on individuals with disabilities.</p>  <p>Thus, employers, insurers and unions generally may apply insurance distinctions, such as applicable limitations and exclusions, provided that they apply the distinctions uniformly to all employees. For example, employers may offer health insurance that does not cover pre-existing conditions for a period of time specified in the plan, even if that exclusion for pre-existing conditions adversely affects employees with disabilities.</p>  <p>The ADA also generally permits facially neutral limitations such as lifetime coverage caps applied to all employees. Further, a health plan may exclude or limit coverage for specific procedures or treatments if they are not exclusively or nearly exclusively applicable to a particular disability. For example, a plan may limit the number of blood transfusions or x-rays that the plan will pay for, even though this may have an adverse effect on individuals with certain disabilities such as hemophilia. Likewise, a plan may limit or deny coverage for all &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; drugs and/or treatments for all &ldquo;elective surgery.&rdquo; Plans may also exclude or provide lower levels of coverage for broad categories of conditions that are not drawn along lines of disability, such as treatment of &ldquo;mental or nervous conditions&rdquo; or &ldquo;eye care.&rdquo;</p>  <p>However, all such provisions are allowable under the ADA only if they meet the requirements of applicable state law and are not used as a subterfuge. Health plan terms also must meet the requirements of other applicable federal laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Mental Health Parity Act.</p>  </div>  <h2>What is a &ldquo;disability-based distinction?&rdquo;</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The EEOC&rsquo;s enforcement guidance identifies a plan term or provision as disability-based if it singles out a particular disability, a discrete group of disabilities, disability in general (all conditions that substantially limit a major life activity), or a treatment or procedure used exclusively or nearly exclusively to treat a particular disability.</p>  <p>What justifies a disability-based distinction? The most reliable way for a health plan to comply the ADA is to avoid singling out diseases or conditions considered disabilities under the ADA.</p>  <p>However, if the plan does single-out a disabil&shy;ity or disabilities, the EEOC 1993 Enforcement Guidance requires the respondent employer (or employer&rsquo;s insurer, if any), to prove that a disability-based distinction is permitted by: (1) showing that the health plan either is a bona fide plan that is consistent with state law or is a bona fide self-funded plan; and (2) prov&shy;ing that the disability-based risk classification is not being used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the law. Plan sponsors may use accepted principles of insurance risk classifica&shy;tion and current and accurate actuarial data, but not data based on myths, fears, stereo&shy;types or false or outdated assumptions about a disability. Disability-based limitations or exclusions will not be considered to violate the ADA if:</p>  <ul>  <li>they are based on legitimate actuarial data, or actual or reasonably anticipated experi&shy;ence, and apply equally to conditions with comparable actuarial data and/or experi&shy;ence; or</li>  <li>they are necessary because no alternative to a disability-based distinction is available to prevent an &ldquo;unacceptable&rdquo; change such as:  <ul>  <li class=\"Pa6\">A drastic increase in premiums, co-pay&shy;ments or deductibles;</li>  <li class=\"Pa6\">A drastic alteration in the scope of cover&shy;age or level of benefits; or</li>  <li class=\"Pa6\">Other changes that would make the plan unavailable to a significant number of other employees, or so unattractive that the employer could not compete in re&shy;cruiting and maintaining qualified work&shy;ers due to the superiority of health insur&shy;ance plans offered by other employers in the community, or so unattractive as to result in significant adverse selection.</li>  </ul>  </li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>What is a &ldquo;subterfuge?&rdquo;</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The EEOC and some courts define &ldquo;subterfuge&rdquo; as any disability-based disparate treatment that is not based on actuarial data or the employer&rsquo;s actual or reasonably anticipated experience relating to the risk involved. This means that any coverage limits or exclusions based on disability must be justified by sound actuarial data or other legitimate business or insurance justification.</p>  <p>For example, a cap on benefits for AIDS-related illnesses that is substantially lower than that for other illnesses would be a disability-based distinction. The lower AIDS cap would violate the ADA unless the disability-based distinction could be justified by actuarial data. Studies demonstrating that the cost of AIDS is comparable to the costs of other commonly covered conditions make it unlikely that this type of disparate treatment could be justified.</p>  <p>That same plan also may be found to have used the insurance exemption as a subterfuge if it used an AIDS cap to deter people with AIDS from accepting employment or enrolling in the plan.</p>  </div>  <h2>How does the ADA apply to dependent coverage?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Disability-based distinctions involving dependent coverage will be analyzed in the same fashion as disability-based distinctions in employee coverage. The ADA, however, does not require that the coverage accorded dependents be the same in scope as the coverage accorded employees. For example, a $100,000 benefit cap for employees but only a $50,000 cap for dependents would be permitted.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,'2014-04-11 03:38:04','This brochure was written by Gwen Thayer Handelman, Scholar in Residence, Nova Southeastern University, Shepard Broad Law Center, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in May 1994.

Those who are known or perceived to be infected with the human immu&shy;nodeficiency virus (HIV) meet the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. An individual with a disability under the ADA is an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Before the Amendments Act was passed, the Supreme Court held that an indi&shy;vidual with asymptomatic HIV had a disability because she was substantially limited in the major life activity of reproduction. The Amendments Act added immune system function to the list of bodily functions that are considered major life activities. Therefore, persons who are HIV-positive or who are diagnosed with AIDS fall squarely within the definition of a disability under the ADA.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What Can an Employer Ask About the Medical Condition of an HIV-Positive Person?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Prior to making a job offer, employers may not ask job applicants about the existence, nature, or severity of a disability, nor may an employer require any ap&shy;plicant to undergo a medical examination. Thus, an employer cannot ask appli&shy;cants if they have HIV infection, AIDS, or any opportunistic infection associated with AIDS. Nor can an employer require any applicant to take an HIV antibody test because that is a medical examination. However, employers may ask ap&shy;plicants about their ability to perform specific job functions, without reference to any disability. The ADA allows an employer to ask individu&shy;als whether they have HIV infection or AIDS only after the employer has extended a condi&shy;tional offer of employment. However, ques&shy;tions must be asked of all individuals entering a job category, not just an individual suspected of HIV infection. In addition, test results and medical history records must be segregated from personnel records and there are strict confidentiality requirements. If a conditional job offer is withdrawn because of the results of such examination or inquiry, an employer must be able to show that:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>&bull; the reasons for the exclusion are job-relat&shy;ed and consistent with business necessity; and</p>  <p>&bull; there is no reasonable accommodation that will enable this individual to perform the essential functions; or</p>  <p>&bull; that any reasonable accommodation will impose an undue hardship.</p>  <p>A post-offer medical exam may disqualify a person on the basis that he or she poses a di&shy;rect threat to the health and safety of employ&shy;ees or others in the workplace. In determining whether the applicant or employee imposes a direct threat upon others, the employer&rsquo;s decision must be objectively reasonable, based upon available medical evidence. The em&shy;ployer also must determine that no reasonable accommodation would reduce or eliminate that direct threat.</p>  <p>Information that an individual is infected with HIV will rarely justify withdrawal of a job offer. In most cases, HIV infection and AIDS will not interfere with the individual&rsquo;s ability to perform essential job functions. Moreover, the individual is entitled to a reasonable ac&shy;commodation to permit performance of es&shy;sential job functions. Since the mere fact that an individual is infected with HIV almost never justifies revoking a job offer, employers may want to consider whether it is advisable to make such inquiries. Similarly, employers may not want to conduct HIV testing because the results alone will not justify revocation of a job offer. Asking current employees whether they have HIV infection or AIDS, or requiring employees to take an HIV antibody test, will rarely be permissible under the ADA, unless the employer can show that such inquiries or testing is job-related and consistent with the employer&rsquo;s business necessity.</p>  <h2>What is Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The critical concept in the employment provi&shy;sions (Title I) of the ADA is that of &ldquo;reasonable accommodation.&rdquo; Reasonable accommodation is any modification or adjustment to a job, an employment practice, or the work environ&shy;ment that makes it possible for a qualified individual with a disability to participate in and enjoy an equal employment opportunity. The employer&rsquo;s obligation to provide a reason&shy;able accommodation applies to all aspects of employment, beginning with the application process; the duty is ongoing and may arise any time a person&rsquo;s disability or job changes. An employer is not required to provide an accom&shy;modation that will impose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer&rsquo;s business. However, an employment opportunity cannot be denied to a qualified applicant or employee solely because of the need to provide reason&shy;able accommodation.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>If the cost of the accommodation would im&shy;pose an undue hardship on the employer, the employer should determine if financial or technical assistance is available elsewhere, or the individual with a disability should be given the option of paying that portion of the cost that constitutes an undue hardship for the employer. Since estimates show as many as 1 in 250 Americans is infected with HIV, accommoda&shy;tion in the workplace for infected individuals who can continue to work makes economic sense, as well as common sense. The presence of these individuals in the workplace poses little or no threat of transmission, and their experience on the job is an asset to be retained. In addition, even those HIV-infected individu&shy;als who develop full-blown AIDS are able to remain productive members of the workforce for extended periods. These working years are increasing due to new treatments being intro&shy;duced for HIV infection. If the cost of the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer, the employer should determine if financial or technical assistance is available elsewhere, or the individual with a disability should be given the option of paying that portion of the cost that constitutes an undue hardship for the employer.</p>  <p>Since estimates show as many as 1 in 250 Americans is infected with HIV, accommodation in the workplace for infected individuals who can continue to work makes economic, as well as common sense.

In addition, even those HIV-infected individuals who develop full-blown AIDS are able to remain productive members of the workforce for extended periods. These working years are increasing due to new treatments being introduced for HIV infection.</p>  <h2>What Types of Accommodations Should be Considered for HIV- Positive Employees?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>It is helpful if employers have established policies on non-discrimination for persons with life-threatening illnesses. These policies should emphasize that employees with illness&shy;es such as cancer, AIDS, and heart disease may wish and be able to work a regular or modi&shy;fied work schedule. Most people infected with HIV do not show any symptoms of disease for many years after infection.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>If the HIV-positive employee eventually be&shy;comes unable to perform certain essential job functions, the employer must consider wheth&shy;er reasonable accommodation will permit him/ her to perform these functions.</p>  <p>Examples include: &bull; time to allow for medical appointments, treatment, and counseling; &bull; auxiliary aids and services, for example, large print for someone with AIDS who has developed a vision impairment; and &bull; additional unpaid leave.</p>  <h2>Which Employee Records Require Confidential Handling?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA imposes very strict limitations on the use of information obtained from medical in&shy;quiries and examinations, including informa&shy;tion relating to a person&rsquo;s HIV infection/AIDS. Employers must treat all such information as a confidential medical record. They should col&shy;lect and maintain these records on forms and in medical files separate and apart from em&shy;ployee personnel files. The medical informa&shy;tion cannot be shared with others, subject to the following five exceptions: sharing medical information with supervisors and managers about necessary restrictions on the worker, or duties of an employee, and necessary accom&shy;modations; performing first aid and informing safety personnel if the individual is in need of emergency medical treatment; sharing infor&shy;mation with government officials that are in&shy;vestigating compliance with the ADA or other federal or state disability discrimination laws; disclosing to state workers&rsquo; compensation of&shy;fices or &ldquo;second injury&rdquo; funds; and disclosing to insurance companies.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What if the Employer is Concerned that it May be Unsafe for the Person who is HIV Positive to Remain in the Workplace?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>As previously mentioned, the ADA does not require an employer to hire or retain an indi&shy;vidual whose disability poses a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; to the health or safety of employees and others in the workplace. Direct threat means that an individual poses a significant risk of substan&shy;tial harm to employees or others, and covers concerns about transmission of infectious dis&shy;eases, including HIV infection. A direct threat determination must be done on an individu&shy;alized basis, assessing the individual with a disability, her essential job functions, and the workplace. The assessment of risk must also be based on current, objective medical orother factual evidence. A risk that is remote or speculative will not constitute a direct threat. If a direct threat is identified, the employer must determine whether a reasonable accom&shy;modation will eliminate or reduce the risk so that it is below the level of a direct threat.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Medical and public health authorities have established that HIV infection cannot be trans&shy;mitted through casual, social contact as exists in the vast majority of jobs and workplaces. Nor is HIV infection transmissible through food or food handling. As a result, HIV infec&shy;tion in the workplace will rarely constitute a direct threat and thus can almost never be the basis for firing or refusing to hire an individu&shy;al with HIV infection.</p>  <p>An employer will violate the ADA if it treats a person with HIV infection or AIDS differently because of speculative concerns that the indi&shy;vidual may have an infectious, opportunistic, and communicable illness and may infect others. The fact that a person has HIV infec&shy;tion or AIDS does not mean the person has, for example, tuberculosis or any other similar ill&shy;ness. Thus, it would be discrimination for an employer to refuse to hire a person with HIV infection because of undocumented concerns that the person might have or might develop in the future one or more infectious diseases. This scenario does not pose a direct threat un&shy;der the ADA because it is based upon specula&shy;tion. The employer has the burden of proving that an individual&rsquo;s employment poses a direct threat, and it is important that appropriate medical or public health resources and exper&shy;tise be available to the employer to assist in making such accommodation decisions.</p>  <p>A different scenario arises when an HIV-positive employee works in an environment that poses a risk to his or her own health. For example, a child-care worker with a compro&shy;mised immune system may consider tempo&shy;rary removal from exposure to children who have measles. In such circumstances, there is no direct threat to the health or safety of oth&shy;ers in the workplace and so the direct threat defense to employment discrimination on the basis of disability is not available to the em&shy;ployer.</p>  <h2>Does The ADA Affect the Employer\'s Choice of Insurance Benefits Where Coverage of HIV-Positive Persons is Concerned?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Employees with HIV infection/AIDS must be given equal access to whatever insurance or benefit plans the employer provides. An employer cannot fire or refuse to hire an indi&shy;vidual with HIV infection/AIDS because the individual may increase the employer&rsquo;s future health care costs. Similarly, an employer can&shy;not fire or refuse to hire an individual because the individual has a family member or depen&shy;dent with HIV infection/AIDS that may in&shy;crease the employer&rsquo;s future health care costs. However, universal pre-existing condition clauses are permissible.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>The EEOC has published guidance on health insurance plans that single out HIV infection, or any other disability for different treatments. Health plans that exclude coverage of HIV infection or place a lower cap on HIV as com&shy;pared with other disabilities may violate the ADA if the employer cannot justify the differ&shy;ences in coverage.</p>  <h2>Where Can I Find Resources to Assist in Accommodating the HIV-Positive Employee and Provide General Education on HIV to Our Workplace?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Workplace education, which emphasizes that HIV and AIDS are not transmitted by casual contact, may allow such an employee to be ac&shy;commodated within a supportive atmosphere. It will also serve to reassure co-workers that they are not at risk, and thus help preserve workforce productivity. The following are some possible resources to assist in the design of training for supervisors and co-workers or in the identification of an accommodation for a particular individual.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This publication was written in 1994, updated  in 2001 by a representative of the New York  State Department of Health AIDS Institute and  updated in February 2002 and May 2010 by  Nellie J.

HR professionals are involved with recruitment, pre-employment screening and testing, and the reasonable accommodation process, as well as benefits, performance management, disability leave, and other parts of the employment process. Because of this broad involvement, they are in a key position to help their organizations minimize disability employment dis&shy;crimination and maintain ADA compliance. The purpose of this publication is to point out some places where the contribution of HR professionals can help busi&shy;ness organizations create a culture and process that will facilitate the accommo&shy;dation requirements of the ADA and minimize the likelihood of discrimination against applicants and employees with disabilities.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Approximately 14 percent of Americans have some form of disability.1 Many of these individuals are unemployed or underemployed, compared to their non-disabled peers, and represent a significant, and as yet untapped, U.S. labor pool.</p>  <p>In order to examine continuing barriers to employment for people with disabili&shy;ties in the years since the passage of the ADA, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) partnered with Cornell University to conduct a survey of SHRM membership in the fall of 1998. The research was based on the premise that the implementation of the employment provisions of disability nondis&shy;crimination legislation is often a function of HR professionals, who are typically responsible for employment policies and practices that affect the hiring and re&shy;tention of workers with and without disabilities.2 This guide offers suggestions for maximizing the contribution of HR professionals toward implementation of the ADA, and makes recommendations based upon what this survey revealed about SHRM members.</p>  <h2>1) Encourage applicants with disabilities, and minimize needless discrimination in the pre-employment process</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Approximately 34 percent of men and 35 per&shy;cent of women with disabilities in the United States were employed during 1999, compared to 95 percent of men and 82 percent of women without disabilities.3 Although the ADA does not require affirmative action, as the Reha&shy;bilitation Act does for federal contractors of $10,000 or more and for recipients of federal funds, these statistics affirm that people with disabilities remain a largely untapped labor pool. HR professionals can encourage and facilitate application by individuals with dis&shy;abilities for open positions by making sure that local agencies that provide vocational rehabilitation services are aware of job open&shy;ings. Some of these agencies are state voca&shy;tional rehabilitation agencies (listed in the yellow pages of your phone book), supported employment or community rehabilitation pro&shy;grams, one-stop or workforce state investment centers, and others.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>HR professionals can also help individuals with disabilities to enter the workforce by minimizing needless screening-out of people with disabilities via pre-employment screen&shy;ing and testing. Job applications and job in&shy;terviews should include neither medical or disability-related inquiries, nor inquiries about prior workers&rsquo; compensation claims; indeed, the ADA bans such inquiries before a condi&shy;tional job offer is made. Any pre-employment medical screening must occur post-offer, and other pre-employment screening that does oc&shy;cur should be consistent with actual job needs and business necessity. In addition, the recruitment, application, and interview processes must be made accessible to candidates with mobility, visual, and hear&shy;ing disabilities. Having recruitment materials and application forms in alternate formats and knowing where to access sign language interpreters in your community are examples of good preparation for access. Further infor&shy;mation about pre-employment screening and pre-employment testing is available in other brochures in this series.</p>  <h2>2) Review all employment process policies, procedures, and forms for disability discrimination and access considerations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The recruitment and applicant screening process is a good first place to start your as&shy;sessment of the organization&rsquo;s policies and procedures in regard to effective outreach to people with disabilities, and minimizing barri&shy;ers in the application and screening processes. The ADA applies throughout the employment process, however, and HR professionals must therefore scrutinize the entire employment process with disability nondiscrimination in mind. For example, benefits programs, such as medical and hospitalization, accident, life insurance, retirement, and workers&rsquo; compensa&shy;tion programs should be examined to assure equity for persons with disabilities in these plans. Although employers can use actuarial data as approved by their state insurance boards, disability-specific exclusions or limita&shy;tions are prohibited.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Equitable access to other benefits of employ&shy;ment, such as use of the cafeteria, in-house or contracted sports facilities for employee use, and other periodic recreational and social activities should also be examined for accessi&shy;bility to employees with disabilities. It should be determined whether facilities are accessible to individuals who are mobility-impaired, and whether appropriate signage is in place for persons with visual impairments. Employee training and other career develop&shy;ment opportunities must be equitably avail&shy;able to the organization&rsquo;s employees with disabilities. Opportunities for advancement should be made available to all employees, and facilities and training approaches must be examined to ensure accessibility for employees with disabilities. Are web sites or print train&shy;ing announcements accessible to persons with visual and hearing impairments? Are training facilities wheelchair accessible, and are train&shy;ing materials available in alternate formats (large print, disk/CD, flash drive, audio-tape and/or Braille)?</p>  <p>Similarly, grievance, lay-off, termination, and discharge processes should be examined to en&shy;sure that individuals with disabilities are not disparately treated in these processes.</p>  <h2>3) Create an organizational structure to support the accommodation process</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The EEOC encourages an informal, interactive process between the employee and the rep&shy;resentative of the organization to determine reasonable accommodations. The organiza&shy;tional representative may be the supervisor, the HR professional, or another person. Al&shy;though an individual seeking accommodation may initially approach only his or her super&shy;visor, the accommodation process often is a multi-level problem-solving process that may involve many other members of the organiza&shy;tion. In the Cornell University study of SHRM members, about one-quarter of respondents said that the HR person alone made the final decision about accommodations, while an ad&shy;ditional ten percent said that the HR person was involved with other managers in making the decision.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Because an inquiry often will go to the su&shy;pervisor, it is imperative that supervisors are aware of their organization&rsquo;s accommodation decision-making process. HR professionals should educate them about the accommoda&shy;tion requirements of the ADA, and let them know that the HR professional is available to assist in the problem-solving process. HR professionals can also point supervisors to resources to assist in determining what accom&shy;modations will effectively meet the needs of the individual. These may be resources within the organization or within the community at large, including ergonomists, health and safety professionals, or employee assistance profes&shy;sionals. In addition, if there is a cost involved with the accommodation, and the individual business unit is not able to meet that cost, a central office may be the place where addition&shy;al assistance can be sought to help with financ&shy;ing a particular accommodation.</p>  <h2>4) Organizational tracking and recording of accommodations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Although the ADA does not mandate data col&shy;lection regarding accommodations, it can be useful for organizations to put an accommoda&shy;tion-tracking mechanism in place. This allows the organization to document its good faith effort to respond to accommodation requests from its personnel. Furthermore, it will build its institutional memory of effective accommo&shy;dations for particular job categories and dis&shy;ability issues.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Almost half of the SHRM/Cornell survey respondents indicated that their organizations keep data on the accommodations made for employees with disabilities so that they will have information for future accommodations in similar situations. About one-third of re&shy;spondents also keep data to fulfill reporting requirements for other regulations, for use in dispute resolution, and for tracking accommo&shy;dation costs. About a third of respondents said their organizations do not keep data on the provision of accommodations.</p>  <h2>5) Top management commitment to disability nondiscrimination</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No significant organizational change occurs without top-down commitment from organi&shy;zational leadership. Similarly, to ensure effec&shy;tive recruitment, hiring, integration, and ac&shy;commodation of individuals with disabilities, top management must affirm and effectively communicate the importance of recruiting and retaining individuals with disabilities. This can be part of a message about the importance of diversity, which should be made explicit to engage the administrative and supervisory structure of the organization in assisting with this effort. Conveying that top leadership sees this as not only a compliance issue, but also as good business, sends the right message and can positively impact workplace compliance with the ADA. In the Cornell University study of SHRM members, high-level management commitment was seen as the most effective way to minimize continuing barriers for peo&shy;ple with disabilities in the workplace.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>6) Clarify position requirements and performance expectations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA does not require employers to have written job descriptions. But properly pre&not;pared job descriptions are critical in effective performance management. Accurate job de&not;scriptions are a tool to effectively recruit and retain good employees, including those with disabilities. Job descriptions are a road map for supervisors, interviewers, medical staff, and even applicants and employees through&not;out the employment process. Prior to recruitment and posting, organiza&not;tions should prepare a job description identi&not;fying the current essential functions of the job being filled. They should distribute copies to applicants, so that any need for accommoda&not;tion can be identified and addressed. Once a person has been hired, job descriptions can also be used to clarify performance expec&not;tations. Persons with disabilities can be held to the same performance standards as others in the job category, but necessary reasonable accommodations must be provided, unless it would be an undue hardship to do so.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>7) Provide training and continuing communication on ADA requirements</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Training is key. Training is important at all levels of the organization. Not just interview&shy;ers. Not just hiring supervisors or administra&shy;tors, but all employees. Why? The ADA isn&rsquo;t just a law to provide equal access to individu&shy;als with disabilities. It&rsquo;s also about sensitivity, about looking at our behaviors and attitudes to determine whether we may be part of the problem in ensuring equal access. This allows us to make sure we are part of the solution in providing equal employment opportunity.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>SHRM membership respondents in the Cor&shy;nell study reported conducting extensive training for their HR professionals, but signifi&shy;cantly less training for supervisors in business organizations. To be truly effective, disability nondiscrimination training must reach to the supervisory level to inform supervisors of their responsibilities under the ADA. Use&shy;ful training topics include: confidentiality requirements of medical information, nondis&shy;crimination in the disciplinary or termination processes, nondiscriminatory recruitment and hiring practices defining essential job func&shy;tions, and the accommodation process. Further information on training and the ADA is found in another brochure in this series.</p>  <h2>8) If in a unionized environment, involve your union representatives</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The union can play a role in helping an indi&shy;vidual with a disability to get the accommoda&shy;tion he or she needs to perform effectively in the workplace. Your unions are also subject to the ADA regulations. You will want to work closely with them to ensure there is flexibility in the contracts to allow accommodations to be made, if appropriate. Regulations implement&shy;ing the ADA suggest that the terms and condi&shy;tions of a collective bargaining agreement may be used as a factor in determining whether an accommodation would be an undue hard&shy;ship. However, you will want to look at all the factors and focus on good faith efforts with the union. The key is to focus on the joint legal obligation to ensure that an employee with a disability gets a necessary reasonable accom&shy;modation.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In the SHRM/Cornell study, respondents indicated that unions could contribute to the accommodation process in the following ways: providing representation in reasonable accom&shy;modation discussions, providing advice or information on ways to accommodate employ&shy;ees with disabilities, providing representation in grievance discussions when accommoda&shy;tion requests are denied, and consulting with employers on revising employment policies. Unions also provided information on the rights of employees with disabilities.</p>  <h2>9) Use your disability management and diversity programs to support ADA compliance</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Respondents in the Cornell University study reported that one of the areas where they made the most effort to make changes in response to the ADA was co-worker and supervisor attitudes towards people with disabilities. This was also seen as one of the most difficult areas to change. This feedback from SHRM members suggests that attitu&shy;dinal issues continue to be a problem in the workplace for people with disabilities, and that continuing attention should be directed toward addressing attitudinal barriers. Diver&shy;sity programs may be an area where sensitiv&shy;ity training or disability awareness training can occur. Again, affirming the organization&rsquo;s commitment to hiring and retaining individu&shy;als with disabilities in the workforce, as well as raising awareness of disability etiquette, can effectively assist in dealing with attitudinal issues in the workplace about people with dis&shy;abilities.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>If your organization has a disability manage&shy;ment or return-to-work program, this can be an area that supports ADA compliance. The structure and requirements of such programs lend themselves to increasing awareness of the importance of confidentiality, raising acceptance of people with disabilities in the workplace, increasing supervisor awareness of reasonable accommodation requirements, and creating an organizational structure for accom&shy;modations. The value of disability manage&shy;ment programs in supporting ADA good prac&shy;tice was also shown by the Cornell University Study of SHRM Membership.</p>  <h2>10) Use internal and community resources to address accommodation needs</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>There are numerous individuals who, be&shy;cause of their role or their particular expertise, should be identified and engaged in the orga&shy;nization&rsquo;s overall accommodation process. Al&shy;though the decision about an accommodation is unique to the individual, their disability, and the nature of their job, there are numer&shy;ous resources that may be used for each indi&shy;vidual&rsquo;s situation. Some of the specific experts that can contribute to identification of the most appropriate accommodation for a particular disability are ergonomists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, health and safety professionals, and employee assistance profes&shy;sionals. These are often individuals who are working within larger organizations whose expertise can be applied to the accommoda&shy;tion process as needed. In addition, benefits specialists and labor relations representatives may also be able to assist with a particular accommodation request. Identifying these individuals, and bringing them together on a regular basis to build a sense of the cultural appropriateness of accommodation and the importance of working together to generate positive outcomes is an important part of an effective accommodation process within an organization.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In addition to the above-noted resources that may be found internally in any medium-sized and larger business settings, there are many community resources that can assist in the clarification and identification of accommo&shy;dations for persons with specific disabilities. State vocational rehabilitation agencies have vocational counselors that can be of assistance, and in some cases can help with financing ac&shy;commodations that are beyond the resources of the employer or the specific needs of the employment setting. In addition community centers for independent living can assist with accommodation inquiries that relate to facil&shy;ity accessibility or assistive technology, as well as helping the individual with personal needs such as housing and transportation. Many of these organizations are listed in the yellow pages of the phone book.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Implementation of the ADA program for your organization will take time and effort. But tak&shy;ing a proactive approach to outline your plan is much more effective than reacting later to specific issues or problems. You can take the cautious approach, the insightful approach, or the visionary approach. If employers are sensitive and programmatic in their imple&shy;mentation philosophy and plan, we will start to make some strides in equal employment op&shy;portunity for all individuals, including those with disabilities.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This brochure was written by Susanne Bruyère in July, 2001.

The ADA covers all aspects of participation in society &ndash; employ&shy;ment, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications. The employment provisions of the ADA (Title I) prohibit discrimination against per&shy;sons with disabilities in all facets of employment, including recruitment, pre-em&shy;ployment screening, hiring, training, promotions, employee benefits, layoffs and terminations. The ADA also requires employers to provide necessary reasonable accommodations as a form of nondiscrimination. Employers, human resource professionals, and labor union representatives need to be knowledgeable about the ADA in order to respond appropriately to accommodation requests by work&shy;ers with disabilities and otherwise ensure compliance with the ADA&rsquo;s require&shy;ments. Title I of the ADA is enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportu&shy;nity Commission (EEOC).</p>  </div>  <h2>When will the ADA Impact Injured Workers?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Anytime a worker sustains a significant injury, the ADA may come into play. Title I of the ADA covers private employers, and state and local governments, with 15 or more employees for each working day in 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year. The definition of &ldquo;employer&rdquo; includes persons who are &ldquo;agents&rdquo; of the employer such as managers, supervisors, foremen, or others who act for the employer, such as agencies used to conduct background checks on candidates. Employment agencies, labor organizations, and joint labor management committees must also comply with Title I of the ADA.</p>  <p>When dealing with injured workers, includ&shy;ing previously injured applicants, employers must take into account both state workers&rsquo; compensation laws and federal ADA require&shy;ments. Employers should be particularly alert to possible ADA issues in the areas of hiring and pre-employment medical exams, work&shy;place injuries and employee medical exams, confidentiality of medical information and the provision of reasonable accommodations.</p>  </div>  <h2>Is an Injured Worker Automatically Covered under the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">No. Whether an injured worker is protected by the ADA will depend on whether the person meets the ADA&rsquo;s jurisdictional definition of &ldquo;disability.&rdquo; Under the ADA, the term &ldquo;dis&shy;ability&rdquo; is defined as: (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity; (b) a record of such an impair&shy;ment; or (c) being regarded as having such an impairment. In order to be considered &ldquo;substantially limiting,&rdquo; the impairment must significantly limit the ability of that person to perform the major life activity in question, as compared to most people in the general popu&shy;lation. Those impairments resulting from occupational injury that are not severe enough to substantially limit a major life activity or are only temporary would therefore not constitute a disability covered by the ADA.</p>  <p>Likewise, just because an individual has a record of filing a workers&rsquo; compensation claim does not necessarily mean s/he is covered under the &ldquo;record&rdquo; portion of the definition. The record or history of an impairment must be a record of an impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities.</p>  </div>  <h2>When is an Injured Worker Regarded as Disabled under the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">An injured worker has a disability under the &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; portion of the definition if s/he (1) has an impairment that does not substan&shy;tially limit a major life activity but the employ&shy;er treats him/her as though the impairment is substantially limiting; (2) has an impairment that substantially limits a major life activ&shy;ity because of the attitudes of others towards the impairment; (3) has no impairment, but is treated as though s/he has a substantially limiting impairment.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Example 1: During an office move, an em&shy;ployee sustains an occupational injury result&shy;ing in a temporary back condition that pre&shy;cludes him from heavy lifting. The employer views this person as not being able to lift even a few pounds and refuses to return him to his position even though he is fully capable of doing his job, which only requires the lifting of ordinary light weight items such as a book or small package of paper. This person would qualify as having an ADA disability.</p>  <p>Example 2: An employee sustains serious burns to her face during an on-the-job labo&shy;ratory accident. The person is fully able to return to her duties as a scientist, however, the employer refuses to return her to her posi&shy;tion because it fears the negative reaction of co-workers or clients. The employer regards her as having an impairment that substantially limits the major life activity of interacting with others and working. This employee would have a disability as defined by the ADA.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Example 3: An individual has fully recovered from a back injury. He applies for a new job and the employer refuses to hire him because it assumes that the person will severely injure his back again if he returns to heavy labor. The employer is regarding this applicant as being disqualified from the class of jobs involving heavy labor, and thus substantially limited in the major life activity of working.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Even if an employee is awarded workers\' com&shy;pensation benefits, or is assigned a high work&shy;ers\' compensation disability rating, it is neces&shy;sary to make a case-by-case determination of whether the person is an individual with a disability as defined by the ADA.</p>  <p>The other important prerequisite for ADA coverage is that the person must be qualified for the job. An injured employee or job appli&shy;cant is considered qualified if s/he meets the education, experience and other qualification standards of the job, and is able to perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reasonable accommodation. The concept of reasonable accommodation is covered in great&shy;er detail in a later section of this brochure.</p>  </div>  <h2>Does the ADA Limit an Employer\'s Ability to Find Out About a Person\'s Prior Workers\' Compensation History?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Yes. The ADA limits when an employer may ask about prior workers&rsquo; compensation claims. At the pre-offer stage, an employer may not ask about an applicant&rsquo;s disabilities or ask questions that are likely to elicit information about disability, including questions about workers&rsquo; compensation history. An employer also may not obtain workers&rsquo; compensation information at the pre-offer stage from third parties, such as former employers, state work&shy;ers&rsquo; compensation offices or services that provide workers&rsquo; compensation information. Once the employer has extended an offer of employment to an applicant, however, the rules change. Then, the employer may require medical exams and make disability-related inquiries, including questions about prior workers&rsquo; compensation history, as long as such exams or inquiries are required of all candi&shy;dates in the same job category.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are the ADA Requirements Regarding Pre-Employment Medical Examinations and Disability-Related Inquiries, Including Questions about Workers\' Compensation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">As noted above, the ADA prohibits an employ&shy;er from making disability-related inquiries or requiring a medical examination of appli&shy;cants prior to extending a job offer, but allows employers to engage in the same following a job offer as long as the inquiry or exam is required of all entering employees in the same job category. After an employer has obtained basic medical information from all entering employees in a job category, it may ask specific individuals to take follow-up examinations and/or answer more questions if examinations and inquiries are medically related to the pre&shy;viously obtained medical information.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">If the employer withdraws a job offer because the medical examination reveals that the person does not satisfy certain qualification standards, including safety, vision, or hearing requirements, or did not pass certain job tests, the employer must be able to show that:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; the exclusionary criteria do not screen out on the basis of disability; or</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; the exclusionary criteria are job-related and consistent with business necessity, and there is no reasonable accommodation that will permit the individual with a disability to perform the essential functions of the job.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Where a disability gives rise to safety issues, the employer must still engage in a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; analysis, and should not make an ad&shy;verse employment decision based upon safety concerns regarding the disability in question if the disability does not pose a direct threat. Un&shy;der the ADA, a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; is a significant threat of substantial harm to workplace health or safety that cannot be eliminated or reduced with reasonable accommodation. This is a very high standard to meet and must be based on a factual, individualized inquiry that takes into account the specific circumstances of the indi&shy;vidual with a disability and the job at issue.</p>  <p>Example: An applicant has post traumatic stress disorder, which causes him to lose his concentration and memory at times. He ap&shy;plies for a job driving a truck loaded with highly flammable materials. The employer determines that the applicant presents a direct threat to workplace and public health and safety due to his disability and decides that the applicant is not qualified for the position, with or without accommodation, because his loss of concentration and/or memory while driving could cause an extremely dangerous condi&shy;tion. The employer&rsquo;s decision is justified by the &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; doctrine and therefore would not violate the ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>What if the Employer Thinks the Person\'s Disability or Prior Occupational Injury will Pose an Increased Risk of Workers\' Compensation Costs?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>An employer may not refuse to hire a quali&shy;fied person with a disability simply because it assumes the disability will pose an increased risk of occupational injury and increased workers&rsquo; compensation costs. Similarly, an employer may not refuse to hire an indi&shy;vidual with a disability who has had a previ&shy;ous occupational injury based on general&shy;ized assumptions or stereotypes. Excluding qualified workers with disabilities because of their disability or a previous on-the-job injury constitutes disability discrimination under the ADA, unless the employer can establish that the worker poses a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; to his or her coworkers or to himself/herself.</p>  </div>  <h2>What About Medical Exams or Disability-Related Inquiries at the Time of Injury or When the Person Wants to Return to Work?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA allows an employee to ask disability-related questions or require a medical exami&shy;nation at the time an employee experiences an occupational injury or seeks to return to work after such an injury as long as the inquiries or medical exams are job-related and consistent with business necessity. This requirement is met where an employer reasonably believes that the occupational injury will impair the employee&rsquo;s ability to perform essential func&shy;tions or raises legitimate concerns about di&shy;rect threat. The questions or exams must not exceed the scope of the specific injury and its effect on the employee&rsquo;s ability, with or with&shy;out reasonable accommodation, to perform essential functions or to work without posing a direct threat.</p>  </div>  <h2>Does the ADA Impact How an Employer Determines its Workers\' Compensation Liability?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The ADA does not prohibit an employer from asking disability-related questions or requiring medical exams of employees seeking workers&rsquo; compensation provided that the exams and in&shy;quiries are necessary to ascertain the extent of its workers&rsquo; compensation liability. The ques&shy;tions and exams must be consistent with the state law&rsquo;s purpose of determining eligibility for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. Examina&shy;tions and questions must be limited in scope to the specific occupational injury and may not be required more often than is necessary to determine an individual&rsquo;s initial or continued eligibility for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits.</p>  </div>  <h2>With Whom Can Medical Records be Shared?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Information obtained from permitted medical examinations and disability-related inquiries is a &ldquo;confidential medical record&rdquo; that em&shy;ployers must collect and maintain on separate forms and in medical files separate and apart from personnel files. This includes informa&shy;tion about an applicant&rsquo;s or employee&rsquo;s oc&shy;cupational injury or workers&rsquo; compensation claim. Employers must strictly limit access to such files and comply with the following limi&shy;tations on disclosure:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; supervisors and managers may be in&shy;formed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary accommodations;</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; first-aid safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment;</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; government officials investigating com&shy;pliance with the ADA shall be provided relevant information on request;</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">&bull; employers may give information to state workers&rsquo; compensation offices, state sec&shy;ond injury funds, and workers&rsquo; compensa&shy;tion insurance carriers in accordance with state workers&rsquo; compensation laws; and</p>  <p>&bull; employers may use the information for insurance purposes.</p>  </div>  <h2>May the Employer Require that a Person with a Disability-Related Occupational Injury Return to Full Duty?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No. The term full duty may include both mar&shy;ginal and essential functions. The employee with a disability-related occupational injury<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> must be allowed to return to work as long as s/he can perform the essential functions of the position, with or without reasonable ac&shy;commodation, and s/he does not pose a direct threat.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup> individual with a disability may have an occupational injury that has nothing to do with his disability. EEOC uses the term \"disability-related occupational injury\" to refer to a situation where the ADA and workers\' compensation laws simultaneously apply (i.e., where there is a connection between an occupational injury and a disability as defined under the ADA).</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>What About Return-to-Work Concerns Regarding Future Injury or Increased Workers\' Compensation Costs?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The employer may not refuse to return to work an employee with a disability-related occupational injury because of assumptions about future injury or increased workers&rsquo; compensation costs. The employer would have to establish that the returning worker would pose an immediate and direct threat if returned to his/her former position in order to justify a decision not to allow that worker to return.</p>  </div>  <h2>May an Employer Refuse to Return to Work an Employee With a Workers\' Compensation Rating of &ldquo;Totally Disabled?&rdquo;</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No. Workers&rsquo; compensation laws are different in purpose from the ADA and use different standards. A workers&rsquo; compensation determi&shy;nation of total or permanent disability is never dispositive of the question of whether a person can return to work under the ADA. It may, however, provide relevant evidence about whether the person can perform the essential functions of the job, with or without reason&shy;able accommodation, and without posing a direct threat.</p>  </div>  <h2>Who Makes the Return-to-Work Decision?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The employer is ultimately responsible for deciding whether an employee with a disabili&shy;ty-related occupational injury is able to return to work. The employer may find it helpful to obtain information from a rehabilitation coun&shy;selor, physician, or other specialist regarding the employee&rsquo;s specific functional limitations, abilities, and possible reasonable accommoda&shy;tions. The employer may also obtain useful in&shy;formation from others who are not experts but who have knowledge about the employee&rsquo;s current abilities, limitations and use of reason&shy;able accommodations.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are the ADA\'s Reasonable Accommodation Requirements in the Context of an Occupational Injury?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The ADA requires that an employer make rea&shy;sonable accommodation to the known physi&shy;cal or mental limitations of a qualified individ&shy;ual with a disability, unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship. Reasonable ac&shy;commodation is a modification or adjust&shy;ment to a job, the work environment or the way things are usually done that enables an individual with a disability to enjoy an equal employment opportunity. Other brochures in this series discuss the reasonable accommoda&shy;tion obligation at length. Our discussion here focuses on common questions about reason&shy;able accommodation following a disability-related occupational injury.</p>  <p>The ADA does not require an employer to provide a reasonable accommodation for an employee with an occupational injury who does not have an ADA disability. The employ&shy;er does have the duty of reasonable accommodation, however, if the employee has a disabil&shy;ity-related occupational injury.</p>  </div>  <h2>Leave</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">If the employee has a disability-related oc&shy;cupational injury that leaves him/her tempo&shy;rarily unable to work, the employer may not discharge him/her and must provide leave, as long as this does not impose an undue hardship. The employee would be entitled to return to his/her same position unless the employer can show that keeping the position available for the worker&rsquo;s return would be an undue hardship. If the employer makes this showing, the employer must then consider whether there is a vacant equivalent position to which the individual could be reassigned.</p>  <p>If the employee requests leave as a reasonable accommodation, but the employer can instead provide an accommodation that keeps the em&shy;ployee working, the employer is not required under the ADA to provide the leave. In other words, the ADA gives the employer the right to choose which accommodation to implement in the event that more than one effective ac&shy;commodation exists. If the employee requests leave that the employer routinely grants in similar circumstances to other employees, however, the employer may not force the employee requesting leave to remain on the job if so doing would cause the employer to apply differing standards to employees with and without disabilities. Furthermore, if the employee qualifies for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), the employer may not require him/her to remain on the job with an adjustment/accommodation instead of taking a leave of absence.<a href=\"#2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"2\"><sup>2</sup> 29 C.F.R. Section 825.702(d)(1). In general, when any sort of leave issue arises in an ADA case, employers need to be aware that they may also have FMLA obligations. For on-line information about the FMLA, go to: http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/.</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>On-the-Job Accommodations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">If the employee with a disability-related occupational injury is still able to perform the essential functions of the job, but cannot perform certain marginal functions, the em&shy;ployer must restructure the job by reallocating or redistributing the marginal functions that the person cannot do because of the disabil&shy;ity. Reassignment to an equivalent, vacant position, on either a permanent or temporary basis, is a last resort when the person can&shy;not be accommodated in the current position through job restructuring, modification of equipment or implementation of a part-time schedule. If there is no equivalent position available, the parties may consider reassign&shy;ment to a lower position. The employer and employee may agree to a reassignment at any point if both parties think this is best. If there is no open position for the employee with the disability-related occupational injury, the ADA does not require the employer to create a new position or &ldquo;bump&rdquo; another employee from his/her position.</p>  <p>An employer will not satisfy its ADA reason&shy;able accommodation obligation by placing an employee with a disability-related occu&shy;pational injury in a workers\' compensation vocational rehabilitation program. However, if both the employer and employee agree that this is the best course of action, they are free to choose that option.</p>  <p>An employer is also free to make a workplace modification that is not required under the ADA in order to offset workers&rsquo; compensation costs. For example, an employer might choose to temporarily lower production standards, which is not required by the ADA, in order to return an occupationally-injured employee to work sooner.</p>  </div>  <h2>Light Duty</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The term &ldquo;light duty&rdquo; has a number of differ&shy;ent meanings in the employment setting. The EEOC uses the term to mean particular posi&shy;tions created specifically for the purpose of providing work for employees who are unable to perform all of their normal duties.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">An employer may feel a special obligation arising out of the employment relationship to create a light duty position for an employee who is injured on the job. The EEOC has stated that nothing in the ADA prohibits an employer from creating a light duty job for an employee who is injured on the job, so long as the policy is applied in a non-discriminatory manner to all employees, including those with disabilities.<a href=\"#3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>  <p>The ADA does not require an employer to create &ldquo;light duty&rdquo; positions for a non-occu&shy;pationally injured employee with a disability. The general principal that the ADA does not require employers to create positions ap&shy;plies equally to the creation of light duty jobs. Note, however, that if the &ldquo;heavy duty&rdquo; tasks an injured worker can no longer perform are marginal job functions, they would have to be reallocated to coworkers as part of the reason&shy;able accommodation of job restructuring.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">If an employer chooses to create light duty positions for workers injured on the job, the employer also determines everything about the positions, including the length of time they are available. Thus, if an employer only pro&shy;vides temporary light duty positions, it need only provide a temporary light duty position to an employee with a disability-related occu&shy;pational injury.</p>  <p>The EEOC makes a distinction between the creation of a light duty position, which is not required under the ADA, and the placement of a non-occupationally-injured employee with an ADA disability into an existing light duty position that is reserved for an employee who is injured on the job. The EEOC takes the posi&shy;tion that if an employee with a disability, who is not occupationally injured, becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his/her job and there is no other effective reasonable accommodation, the employer must reassign him or her to the vacant reserved light duty position as a reasonable accommodation. The EEOC has also stated that an employer could not establish undue hardship by showing that it would not have any light duty positions remaining if another employee was subse&shy;quently injured on the job.</p>  <p>Some courts have limited application of the EEOC position to circumstances in which the transfer of a non-occupationally injured em&shy;ployee to a light duty position does not either convert the light duty position into a new position (by, for example, turning a tempo&shy;rary position into a permanent one) or conflict with employer light duty position policies that govern the rights of fellow employees.<a href=\"#4\"><sup>4</sup></a> Em&shy;ployers should take great care to examine all relevant facts in such situations and may wish to obtain legal advice before making an ac&shy;commodation decision.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"3\"><sup>3</sup> The EEOC leaves open the possibility that, should this policy have a disparate impact on a class of individuals with disabilities, the employer would have to show that the policy is job-related and consistent with business necessity.</div>  <div id=\"4\"><sup>4</sup> See, for example, Middleton v.

People living with MS are employed at a much lower rate than others. Although 95% of people with MS have a history of employment, in surveys of people 5 to 15 years after diagnosis, fewer than 35% are working. There are a number of reasons for this high unem&shy;ployment rate, but it is clear that many people living with MS would prefer to be working and could work productively with fairly minor accommodations in the workplace.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What is MS?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>MS is a chronic disease characterized by the progressive destruction of the &ldquo;white&rdquo; matter in the nervous system &ndash; the myelin sheath that protects the nerves and allows for uninterrupted transmission of nerve impulses. This pro&not;gressive demyelinization is initially an inflammatory process that ultimately leads to the destruction of the nerve. The initial inflammation is called an &ldquo;exac&not;erbation&rdquo; and can often be treated using medications to reduce the residual dam&not;age. MS is now thought to be an autoimmune disorder that develops without apparent symptoms earlier in life and for which there is some genetic vulnerabil&not;ity. There are new medications and other treatments that seem to be effective in altering the course of the disease for many people living with MS. Researchers believe a cure is on the not-too-distant hori&not;zon. It is critical that employers and co-work&not;ers understand that MS is not a contagious dis&not;ease: it cannot be transmitted to others under any circumstances.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What are the different courses MS takes?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>There are three primary courses MS can take. With the \"relapsing-remitting\" course, people experience \"relapses\" or \"attacks\" of symptoms, also called exacerbations. People experience partial or total recovery of function after these exacerbations. This is the most common form of MS in the U.S. For some people, the relapsing-remitting course becomes progressive as they get older - that is, the relapses are less noticeable and the symptoms progress steadily. This is the \"secondary progressive\" course. A minority of people with MS have the \"primary progressive\" course in which symptoms progress without remission. Understanding which course MS is taking is critical to designing effective employment accommodations.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are the symptoms or limitations associated with MS?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>It is impossible to predict which symptoms an individual with MS will have, and individu&shy;als may experience symptoms or limitations during an exacerbation that either resolve or are less troubling during remission. Because MS is a disease of the central nervous system, it can cause many kinds of limitations depend&shy;ing on where the &ldquo;flare&rdquo; up occurs. The most common limitation people living with MS re&shy;port is fatigue &ndash; what people with MS call MS fatigue because it is more profound than the fatigue with which most people are familiar. People can also experience difficulty walk&shy;ing, using their hands, or with vision. Some people have difficulty controlling their blad&shy;ders or bowels. Balance can be affected, as can sensation (e.g., in one&rsquo;s hands or fingertips). One troubling limitation experienced by some people living with MS is related to cognitive changes, which can include problems with memory, handling multiple tasks, and think&shy;ing and responding quickly. It is important to remember that, because most people liv&shy;ing with MS have relapsing and remitting symptoms, an individual who experiences significant fatigue, vision changes, problems walking, or memory problems one week may have fewer problems once the exacerbation resolves. In many ways, the unpredictability of the disease and the difficulty others have in &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; the limitations are as disabling as the limitations themselves. For many, living with MS is living with an invisible disability &ndash; a disability that is difficult for the individual him or herself to understand and even more difficult for employers, co-workers, and others to grasp. And yet, when both the individual with MS and others are fully informed, the individual may well be able to continue work&shy;ing productively. Workplace Accommodations for People Living with Multiple Sclerosis</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>The American with Disabilities Act And Reasonable Accomodations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects qualified individuals with dis&shy;abilities against discrimination on the basis of disability in all terms, conditions, and privi&shy;leges of employment, including recruitment, pre-employment screening, hiring, benefits, promotions, layoff, and termination. The ADA defines disability as a physical or mental im&shy;pairment that substantially limits a major life activity, and it specifically identifies the ability to see and to walk, the performance of manual tasks, and the normal operation of neurologi&shy;cal functions, among other things, as major life activities.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In determining whether MS substantially limits one or more major life activities, miti&shy;gating measures are not considered. Thus, if an individual&rsquo;s MS is substantially controlled with medication, he or she could neverthe&shy;less qualify as an individual with a disability entitled to ADA protections. Furthermore, as long as a person&rsquo;s MS substantially limits a major life activity when active, its episodic nature will not prevent it from being classified as a disability.</p>  <p>Employers must reasonably accommodate qualified persons with disabilities so that they may perform the essential functions of jobs held or desired, but employers do not have to provide an accommodation if it would impose an undue hardship on the business. Successful accommodations are often minor, however, requiring little or no expense. Suc&shy;cessful accommodations should be conceived and implemented in collaboration with the employee with MS &ndash; this employee has the most expertise on his or her own disease, limitations, and potentially successful accom&shy;modations. In fact, most people with MS have developed and employed a variety of informal accommodations on their own. Employees with MS also may require accommodations for several limitations and it is important that these accommodations be coordinated.</p>  <h2>Fatigue</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>During or immediately after an ex&shy;acerbation, an individual may feel profoundly fatigued most of the time and may need to limit work activities for several weeks. For others, fatigue may be a constant limitation. It is not unusual for individuals to report that their &ldquo;best times&rdquo; are in the morning and they become progressively more fatigued dur&shy;ing the day. Modifying the schedule of work activities so that the employee can engage in tasks demanding more physical and cognitive effort in the morning may be useful. sensa&shy;tion, it is more difficult to type accurately and manipulate small objects. Keyboarding can be enhanced by placing Velcro or other tactile stimuli on &ldquo;location&rdquo; keys, or by using soft&shy;ware which gives confirmation of keystrokes. Experimenting with different computer point&shy;ing devices such as joysticks may also be useful. Some people will find the voice rec&shy;ognition systems described earlier helpful in reducing the amount of keyboarding required. For assembly work or related tasks, jigs may be designed to hold or guide objects and small parts.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Motor Weakness</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>An ergonomic work envi&shy;ronment is a critical first step in the accom&shy;modation process. Ensure that the employee is properly positioned in the seat to minimize pain and fatigue, and that tasks in which the employee must engage are ergonomically po&shy;sitioned. When considering an office setting, this includes not only the keyboard, but also the computer mouse, alternative computer access tools, and monitor height. A number of reasonably priced adjustable workstations are now available that allow the keyboard, mouse, and monitor to be positioned independently. Some employees will find that using voice recognition software such as Dragon Naturally Speaking is helpful. This software allows the employee to dictate text to the computer. With either voice recognition or keyboarding, com&shy;puter use becomes more efficient when routine tasks are automated using macro language. For example, in Microsoft Word, the autotext or auto-correct features may be employed so that the user can substitute a two or three letter combination for blocks of frequently used text. Using compressed keyboards may reduce fatigue and alternative mouse devices may improve access to the computer. An employee can try out a variety of off-the-shelf devices at most well-stocked computer stores. The employee may want to consider keeping some type of power mobility at work, such as a scooter or power chair, to facilitate travel within the workplace. Similar considerations should be made in other work settings as well.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Vision Changes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Vision changes are often transitory but vision may deteriorate over time. High quality computer monitors with good contrast provide a good foundation for a computer station. Screen enlargement software and contrast enhancement included as accessibility features in both Microsoft and Mac operating systems. Excellent screen enlargement software, which also \"reads\" to the user with synthesized speech, is available from vendors such as ZoomText. Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) can be used to enhance the contrast and size of print for employees. Various fixed and moveable lenses can allow people to magnify their work. Accommodating vision changes often requires consultation with a specialist in low vision.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Bowel and Bladder Control</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>These issues are usually managed by the employee and the employee&rsquo;s medical team. As an accommoda&shy;tion, the employer may need to provide easy access to the restroom, an opportunity for the employee to change clothes, the opportunity to carefully schedule meals, and perhaps the option to work at home during times when bowel and bladder problems could be more acute.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Bowel and Bladder Control</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>These issues are usually managed by the employee and the employee&rsquo;s medical team.

This loss of sensa&shy;tion would often be accompanied by a loss of strength. For someone with decreased sensa&shy;tion it is more difficult to type accurately and manipulate small objects. Keyboarding can be enhanced by placing Velcro or other tactile stimuli on &ldquo;location&rdquo; keys, or by using soft&shy;ware which gives confirmation of keystrokes. Experimenting with different computer point&shy;ing devices such as joysticks may also be useful. Some people will find the voice rec&shy;ognition systems described earlier helpful in reducing the amount of keyboarding required. For assembly work or related tasks, jigs may be designed to hold or guide objects and small parts.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Cognitive Changes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The idea of requiring accommodation for cognitive changes may be frightening for an employee, but many of these accommodations are quite simple, non-intrusive, and allow the employee to work more effectively. In some cases, these accommodations have been so intuitive and efficient that other employees have asked to have access to them! The accommodations described earlier for fatigue may also be helpful to address cognitive changes since the two are often intertwined. Many people use memory books or computer calendars (e.g., personal digital assistants) to help with memory problems. Some employees email themselves reminders to keep a \"to do\" list in their in-boxes. Desktop computer programs such as Microsoft Outlook can help manage schedules, \"to-do lists, and contact lists. These calendar programs can also be configured to send text messages from calendar entries to text pagers or cell phones that accept text messages. This allows an employee to put reminders into a computer calendar system and have those reminders sent to his or her text pager during the day. Structuring the work tasks to maximize routine, minimize distractions, and to sequence work efforts to reduce the demands of multitasking may be helpful. Employers and employees with MS should begin by completing an analysis of the cognitive demands of the job, including interpersonal demands, before beginning the accommodation process.</p>  </div>  <h2>Unpredictability of Symptoms</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>When plan&shy;ning accommodations in the workplace for people with MS, it is critical to consider the progression of MS. While the progression of limitations cannot be predicted, it makes sense when planning accommodations for current needs to consider the future as well. Accom&shy;modations should also address episodic ex&shy;acerbations where an employee may require a week of hospitalization or recovery from an exacerbation and perhaps a brief, graduated return to work.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Working and Living with MS</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Most people with MS are of working age and either want to continue working or, if not cur&shy;rently at work, return to the workforce. Many people with MS do not have limitations that impact their employment. For those indi&shy;viduals who do have significant MS-related limitations affecting their employment, many can work successfully with reasonable accom&shy;modations that are typically minor in nature. With recent medical advances relating to MS and advances in awareness and technology regarding job accommodations, MS will pres&shy;ent fewer barriers to employment in the near future.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This brochure was developed in 2001 for  Cornell University by Kurt L.

Approximately 33 percent of U.S. adults are affected by musculoskeletal signs or symptoms, including limitation of motion or pain in a joint or extremity which are the leading cause of disability among individu&shy;als of working age (18 to 64 years of age). Annual costs of MSDs [Occupa&shy;tional and Safety Health Act (OSHA) standard (proposed Fed Reg #, month, year)] are estimated to be:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>&bull; $15-$20 billion in workers compensation costs alone</p>  <p>&bull; $45-$50 billion total when including other expenses</p>  <p>Many people with musculoskeletal disorders are considered individuals with disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). An individual with a disability is a person who: has a physical or mental impairment that sub&shy;stantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impair&shy;ment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. Major life activities include functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, bending, communicating, and working. Whether a person\'s impairment substantially limits a major life activity depends on its nature, severity, and its expected permanent or long-term impact. If the impair&shy;ment is episodic in nature, it may nevertheless be classified as a disability pro&shy;vided that it substantially limits a major life activity when active.</p>  <p>Musculoskeletal disorders vary greatly in se&shy;verity and degree of permanence. The provi&shy;sions of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) do not apply to every muscu&shy;loskeletal disorder. The ADA does not cover physical problems that are relatively minimal in nature and severity (e.g., a sprained toe or pulled muscle) or will heal in a short time.</p>  <h2>Implications of the ADA for Individuals with Musculoskeletal Disorders</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Before the passage of the ADA, some employ&shy;ers attempted to screen out persons with dis&shy;abilities during the hiring process out of fear that these people represented an undue safety and workers\' compensation risk. Employers used pre-placement medical examinations to identify the particular disability the applicant had and then used this information to make a hiring decision. The trouble with this ap&shy;proach was that the candidate had no chance to show the employer whether he could actu&shy;ally perform the job.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>The employment provisions of the ADA (Title I) protect all qualified individuals with dis&shy;abilities from discrimination in all employ&shy;ment decisions. Specifically, employers may not inquire about an applicant\'s medical history before making a conditional offer of employment. After a job offer is made, an employer may make disability-related inqui&shy;ries or require medical examinations as long as this policy is applied consistently to all enter&shy;ing employees in a particular job category, is job-related and is consistent with business necessity. All medical information collected is confidential and must be kept in a separate locked file. The employer cannot assume that the applicant is limited in performing the job\'s essential functions merely because he or she has a disability. If the post-offer inquiry shows that the prospective employee will be unable to perform the job without posing a significant risk of harm to oneself or others, the employer cannot refuse to hire such individual unless it first determines that no reasonable accommo&shy;dation would reduce or eliminate the risk.</p>  <h2>What Is Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Reasonable accommodation is the critical concept in the employment provisions (Title I) of the ADA. It is any modification or adjust&shy;ment to a job, employment practice, or work environment that enables a qualified indi&shy;vidual with a disability to participate in and enjoy equal employment opportunity. The employer\'s obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation applies to all aspects of em&shy;ployment. This duty is ongoing and may arise any time a person\'s disability or job changes. A qualified applicant or employee cannot be denied an employment opportunity because of the need for reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In order to determine what accommodations may be necessary, the employer must identify the essential functions of the job. Job functions may be considered essential for several rea&shy;sons:</p>  <p>1. the position exists so that the function can be performed;</p>  <p>2. a limited number of employees are avail&shy;able among whom the performance of the job function can be distributed; or</p>  <p>3. the function is highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for her expertise or ability to perform it.</p>  <p>If the employee is otherwise qualified to per&shy;form a job but requires a reasonable accommo&shy;dation to accomplish an essential job function, she cannot be discriminated against in any aspect of the employment process. Employers are not required to hire or retain any individ&shy;ual who poses a direct threat to the health and safety of himself or others, however. Any em&shy;ployer who believes this to be the case bears the burden of proving it and also of showing that no reasonable accommodation can either eliminate that threat or reduce it to an accept&shy;able level.</p>  <p>Employers are also not required to provide any accommodation that would impose an undue burden on their business. The ADA requires that employers consider all sources of outside funding when assessing whether a particular accommodation is too costly. This could include funding from outside organiza&shy;tions, tax credits or tax deductions. Moreover, if the cost of an accommodation would im&shy;pose an undue burden on the employer, the employer must give the individual with the disability the opportunity to provide his or her own accommodation or to pay that portion of the cost that would otherwise constitute an undue burden for the employer.</p>  <h2>What Types of Accommodations Should Be Considered?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Workplace changes for people with muscu&shy;loskeletal disabilities fall into two general categories: engineering accommodations and administrative accommodations.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Engineering accommodations include changes to the physical work environment and equip&shy;ment such as:</p>  <p>&bull; Selecting the right tool for a given job. Tools come in many different sizes, shapes and capacities. Tools should be selected that minimize physical stress so that workers don&rsquo;t have to reach or bend their wrists; the tools don&rsquo;t produce high pres&shy;sure on workers&rsquo; hands; and the worker does not become fatigued as a result of holding or operating the tool. In addition to selecting the best tool, many accessories are now available to help support the tool and resist reaction forces.</p>  <p>&bull; Providing adjustable workstations (e.g. work tables, keyboard trays, monitor hold&shy;ers and seating). Remember that people differ in size and the way they do things. We do not expect all workers to wear the same size or style shoes and we should not expect them to all use the same size work&shy;station or tools.</p>  <p>&bull; Utilizing lift devices such as lift tables, tilt tables and mechanized lift assists. Lift tables bring items up off the floor and tilt tables reduce the horizontal reach. Both pieces of equipment decrease the amount of forward torso bending to load or unload work objects.</p>  <p>Administrative accommodations include changes in the manner in which work is performed such as:</p>  <p>&bull; Periodic breaks (including micro-breaks, i.e. small recovery periods each work cycle or short breaks each hour). ,p&gt;</p>  <p>&bull; Avoiding incentive systems that discour&shy;age breaks. ,p&gt;</p>  <p>&bull; Education by a health care provider for injured workers that explains their condi&shy;tion and how to pace themselves to avoid re-injury. ,p&gt;</p>  <p>&bull; Education by supervisors and engineers for all workers on how to adjust work equipment, what to do if equipment is not working correctly and where to go for medical services.</p>  <p>&bull; Worker rotation. It is important to make sure that workloads on the different jobs vary enough to provide recovery from high work demands.</p>  <p>&bull; Providing sufficient time for new work&shy;ers to learn and become accustomed to the physical demands of new jobs.</p>  <p>Utilization of these measures will not only make it possible for employers to meet the requirements of the ADA, but will also help prevent future injuries and disabilities and sat&shy;isfy present and future OSHA requirements.</p>  <h2>Maximizing Employee Potential for Success</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>As with any significant change in the work environment, making job site accommodations for a disabled employee may have implications for effective labor relations. For example, an assembly-line worker with a low-back disability is reintroduced into the workplace following a job-related injury. He is able to return to his job because of modifications to his workstation that decrease the physical demands of the job and help to control his symptoms. Other employees with the same job title or union seniority, however, may want similar changes to their workstations to make their jobs less physically demanding.</p>  <p>The employer may feel this is a no-win situation. Not only does she have to pay for the disabled employee\'s accommodation, she also has to face the backlash from other workers who consider the accommodations a form of favoritism to which they are not entitled. Employee education about the ADA may be helpful in this situation.</p>  <p>An employer may not disclose that a particular employee has a disability or needs a reasonable accommodation. However, employees who have been informed about the ADA\'s protections in a general manner will understand that an employer must provide a reasonable accommodation that will enable an employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of his job and thus remain a productive member of the workforce. If accommodations are viewed in this way, there is a distinction between accommodating a disabled worker and making adjustments for able-bodied workers that make their jobs less physically demanding. While an employer may always choose to make ergonomic changes that help to prevent worker injuries, the ADA\'s requirements only extend to qualified individuals with disabilities.</p>  <p>If the dialogue between labor and management concerning the obligation to accommodate the individual with a disability is handled cooperatively, other employees will come to understand that different people can perform the same job in different ways and that the ADA will also protect them in the event of a future disability. By working closely with labor to ease the assimilation of individuals with disabilities back into the workplace, employers can achieve a result that is beneficial to all involved, and can create an atmosphere which facilitates the resolution of future conflicts. Employers may wish to consult experts in the field of labor relations and the ADA for additional guidance.</p>  </div>  <h2>Beyond the ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Understandably, employers worry about the impact of the ADA on the cost of doing busi&shy;ness. In most cases, however, accommodating a worker costs less than disability compensa&shy;tion does. Employers, in fact, have much to gain by investing in ergonomic redesigns for the entire workplace that go beyond the intent of the ADA. It has been estimated, for exam&shy;ple, that the proper design of manual handling tasks can reduce the incidence of industrial back disorders by up to one-third.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Matching individuals to jobs, emphasiz&shy;ing employee skills and abilities rather than limitations, and designing work stations and environments that minimize the likelihood of injury will lead to positive outcomes benefit&shy;ing both employers and employees. In ad&shy;dition, jobs incorporating ergonomic design principles will often have positive impacts on product quality and employee productivity. Joint labor-management ergonomics programs are effective at identifying workplace risk fac&shy;tors and interventions.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'The original was written by Frank N.

You should be aware of the ADA&rsquo;s impact on each of the following areas:</p>  <ul>  <li>Advertising</li>  <li>Applications</li>  <li>Job Descriptions</li>  <li>Interviews</li>  <li>Testing</li>  <li>Medical Exams</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>How Can I Make Sure That Persons with Disabilities Know About the Job and Can Apply?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The recruitment process begins with letting people know that a job is available. There are a number of ways in which employers can ensure that the advertising and application processes are accessible to people with dis&shy;abilities.</p>  <p>Job information should be posted or adver&shy;tised in locations that are accessible to persons with mobility disabilities. Similarly, large print on job notices posted at work sites or in employment offices may help a person with a visual disability to become aware of the job. A job advertisement should include a TTY (tele&shy;communications device for the deaf) phone number (whether or not an address is also given). Although the ADA does not require an employer to initially provide all applicants with written information in a variety of acces&shy;sible formats, an employer should make such formats available upon request.</p>  <p>If the advertisement indicates that the ap&shy;plicant should apply in person, employers should make sure that there is access for those with mobility disabilities, such as accessible parking spaces and ramps, and elevators if the interviews are not held on the first floor. In addition, any table, desk, or computer provid&shy;ed to applicants for the purpose of completing an application should also be accessible.</p>  <p>While the ADA does not require employers to affirmatively target individuals with disabili&shy;ties, many employers choose to inform state agencies or private organizations that work with persons with disabilities about available job openings because it helps their company find qualified new employees.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Do I Know If an Applicant Needs a Reasonable Accommodation for the Application and Hiring Process?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>An employer may include information in the advertisement or on the application form inviting applicants with disabilities to notify them of any reasonable accommodations that they need for the application process. Indi&shy;viduals with certain disabilities may need assistance filling out a paper application or completing a computerized application that requires typing or information be read off the screen. An employer also may tell applicants what the hiring process involves (for example, interview, timed written test, or job demon&shy;stration) and may ask applicants whether they will need a reasonable accommodation for this process. If the disability is not obvious, the employer may require the applicant to provide reasonable documentation from an appropri&shy;ate professional showing that the individual has a covered disability and needs an accom&shy;modation.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Questions Can I Ask on the Job Application?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The purpose of a job application is to gather information on the skills, abilities, training, credentials, and references of the applicant and questions relating to any of these areas are permissible under the ADA. An employer may ask whether applicants can perform any or all job functions. If a disability is obvious or if the applicant indicates that s/he may be unable to perform a specific job function, the employer may ask whether the applicants can perform the job functions &ldquo;with or without reasonable accommodation.&rdquo; An employer also may ask applicants whether they can meet the attendance requirements.</p>  <p>A job application should not contain disabil&shy;ity&ndash;related questions that are likely to elicit information about a disability, including inqui&shy;ries about prior or current illnesses, medication, medical treatment, disabilities, injuries, or workers&rsquo; compensation claims. An applica&shy;tion also should not ask whether an individual needs a reasonable accommodation to perform the functions of the job since the question by itself is likely to elicit information about dis&shy;ability.</p>  </div>  <h2>Will I Have to Change My Job Descriptions?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Under the ADA, a person is considered a qualified individual with a disability if s/he meets all the educational and experience requirements for the position and can perform the essential functions of the job with or with&shy;out reasonable accommodation. Although the ADA does not require an employer to have job descriptions, they can be used as evidence of the essential functions of the job. Be sure that your job descriptions are up-to-date and that they differentiate between the essential and the marginal job duties. Marginal functions are those that are not absolutely necessary for the job, although they might be convenient for the employer.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Should I Interview Job Applicants?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The purpose of the interview is to meet the applicant and learn more about his/her educa&shy;tion, credentials, skills, and work experience in order to determine whether s/he can do the job. Questions about whether an applicant is an individual with a disability, or as to the nature or severity of such disability, are pro&shy;hibited.</p>  <p>A good approach is to describe the job in detail so that the applicant has a reasonable under&shy;standing of what is expected, and then ask the applicant whether s/he can perform the job with or without reasonable accommoda&shy;tion. An employer can also ask applicants to describe or demonstrate how, with or without reasonable accommodation, they will be able to perform any or all job functions, as long as all applicants in the job category are asked to do the same.</p>  <p>Any necessary reasonable accommodations requested by the individual for the interview (for example, an accessible location for a per&shy;son with a mobility disability or a sign lan&shy;guage interpreter for a deaf applicant) should be provided unless it would impose an undue hardship on the employer&rsquo;s business.</p>  </div>  <h2>If an Applicant has an Obvious Disability, Can I Mention It?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>If an employer could reasonably believe that an applicant will not be able to perform an essential job function because of either an obvious disability or a hidden disability that the applicant has voluntarily disclosed, the employer may ask the applicant to describe or demonstrate how s/he would perform that function. Similarly, if the employer reason&shy;ably believes that the applicant will need an accommodation, because of either an obvi&shy;ous disability or voluntary disclosures by the applicant, it may ask whether s/he needs an accommodation and, if so, ask about the type of accommodation required.</p>  </div>  <h2>Does the ADA Prohibit Job Testing?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No. The ADA only prohibits employment tests that screen out individuals on the basis of disability, when it cannot be shown that the test is job-related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity. The ADA&rsquo;s goal is to make sure that individuals with disabilities are not excluded from jobs that they can do. The ADA thus requires a close fit between selection criteria, including job tests, and the applicant&rsquo;s (or employee&rsquo;s) ability to do the job.</p>  <p>Tests that measure aptitude, skills, physical fitness, the ability to do actual or simulated job tasks, and any other non-medical factors can be given to applicants at any time during the pre-employment process since such tests are not considered to be &ldquo;medical examinations&rdquo; under the ADA. Tests must be designed to evaluate performance of the job&rsquo;s essential functions and be accurate predictors of suc&shy;cessful job performance. In addition, a job test relating to an essential function cannot be used to exclude an individual with disability if s/he can pass the test with a reasonable accommo&shy;dation.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Does Reasonable Accommodation Apply to Job Testing?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA protects people with disabilities from being excluded from jobs that they actu&shy;ally can do because a disability prevents them from taking a test or negatively influences the results. As in other areas of the employment process, applicants with disabilities are en&shy;titled to reasonable accommodation in the test&shy;ing process. The ADA also requires that tests be given to people who have impaired sen&shy;sory, speaking or manual skills (including the abilities to see, hear, and process information) in a manner that does not require the use of the impaired skill, unless the test is designed to measure that skill.</p>  <p>For example, a person with dyslexia should be given an opportunity to take a test orally unless reading is the skill being tested. Pro&shy;viding extra time to complete a test may be a reasonable accommodation as long as speed is not the skill being tested. If the applicant has mobility impairment the employer should ensure that the testing site is accessible. As always, the employer need not provide an accommodation that will impose an undue hardship.</p>  <p>It is a good idea to inform applicants in ad&shy;vance about tests that will be administered so that they have an opportunity to request any needed accommodations ahead of time. Oc&shy;casionally, an individual may not realize that s/he will need an accommodation until the test is given. For example, a person with a visual impairment who can usually read printed material finds that she cannot read the test because of an unusually low color contrast between the ink and the paper. In this situa&shy;tion, the employer could provide the test in a higher contrast format at that time, reschedule the test, or make any other effective accommo&shy;dation that would not impose an undue hard&shy;ship.</p>  </div>  <h2>Are There Special Rules for Medical Examinations?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Yes. Medical examinations or disability-relat&shy;ed questions such as a medical questionnaire are prohibited until after you have made a conditional job offer to the applicant. A medi&shy;cal exam is defined as a procedure or test that seeks information about an individual&rsquo;s physi&shy;cal or mental impairments or health.</p>  <p>Employment can be conditioned on the results of post-offer medical exams or disability-relat&shy;ed questions. If medical exams or disability-related questions are required, they must be required of all entering employees in the same job category. You cannot require exams or make inquiries of some applicants but not oth&shy;ers.</p>  </div>  <h2>Can I Disclose Information from a Medical Examination?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>All information obtained from post-offer medical examinations and inquiries must be collected and maintained on separate forms, in separate medical files and must be treated as a confidential medical record. Medical infor&shy;mation must not be placed in an individual&rsquo;s personnel file.</p>  <p>The employer should take steps to guarantee the security of the employee&rsquo;s medical infor&shy;mation, including:</p>  <ul>  <li>keeping the information in a medical file in a separate, locked cabinet, apart from the location of personnel files; and</li>  <li>designating a specific person or persons to have access to the medical file.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Can I Share the Medical Information with Anyone?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>An employer must keep medical information on applicants or employees confidential, with the following limited exceptions:</p>  <ul>  <li>supervisors and managers may be told about necessary job restrictions and ac&shy;commodations;</li>  <li>first aid and safety personnel may be told if the disability might require emergency treatment;</li>  <li>government officials investigating the ADA must be given relevant information on request;</li>  <li>employers may give information to state workers&rsquo; compensation offices, state sec&shy;ond injury funds or workers&rsquo; compensa&shy;tion insurance carriers in accordance with state workers&rsquo; compensation laws; and</li>  <li>employers may use the information for insurance purposes.</li>  </ul>  <p>Medical information may be given to and used by decision-makers involved in the hiring process so that they can make employment decisions consistent with the ADA. In addi&shy;tion, the employer can use the information to determine reasonable accommodations for the individual.</p>  </div>  <h2>What About Safety Concerns?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA does not compel an employer to hire a person who would be a direct threat to the health and safety of others at the work site. Before you decide not to hire someone because you think s/he poses a direct threat, you must first determine that the individual poses a significant risk (i.e., a high probability) of substantial harm to the health and safety of others that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>This determination must be based on an in&shy;dividualized assessment of the individual&rsquo;s present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. The specific risk posed by the individual should be identified. The determination of whether an individual poses a direct threat should be based on the follow&shy;ing factors:</p>  <ol>  <li>the duration of the risk;</li>  <li>the nature and severity of the potential harm;</li>  <li>the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and</li>  <li>the imminence of the potential harm.</li>  </ol>  <p>Your assessment of a direct threat to health or safety must be based upon a reasonable judg&shy;ment that relies on the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best objective evi&shy;dence.</p>  </div>  <h2>What About Safety Concerns?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA does not compel an employer to hire a person who would be a direct threat to the health and safety of others at the work site.

It is the goal of this article to acquaint employers with the legal requirements under the ADA that they must consider in using selection tests.</p>  <p>In order to implement successful selection tests, employers first must be familiar with the legal requirements of the ADA and the rationale behind these requirements. Second, they must identify the specific role of their tests in helping to select qualified employees (in other words, the validity basis for their tests).&nbsp; Third, employers should be familiar with the types of accommodations that are most likely to be effective in preserving the reliability and validity of the tests for people with various disabilities.</p>  </div>  <h2>Legal and Regulatory Requirements</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Under the ADA, it is discriminatory to use se&shy;lection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out individuals with disabilities unless the criteria are shown to be job-related for the po&shy;sition in question and consistent with business necessity. This is to ensure that tests do not act as barriers to the employment of persons with disabilities unless the applicant is unable to perform the essential functions of the job, even with reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>Employers should design selection criteria for jobs to ensure a close fit between the selection criteria and an individual&rsquo;s ability to do the job. Any criterion that tends to screen out an individual with a disability must be related to the position for which the individual is apply&shy;ing and consistent with business necessity. A criterion is consistent with business necessity if it is related to an essential function of the job. In order to reasonably accommodate an applicant during the hiring process, the em&shy;ployer must modify or adjust that process so that a qualified individual with a disability may be considered for the position.</p>  <p>Tests should not be given in formats that require use of the impaired skill, unless it is a job-related skill that the test is intended to measure. For example, it is unlawful to give a written test to a person who is unable to read because of dyslexia, unless the ability to read is the job-related skill that the test is designed to measure. If, instead, the test is designed to measure a factor such as verbal comprehen&shy;sion or reasoning, the test should be given orally. Similarly, test time limits should be relaxed for applicants whose disabilities cause them to need more time to take a test, unless the test is specifically designed to test speed. If speed is necessary to perform an essential job function, however, and no reasonable accom&shy;modation could enable the applicant to dem&shy;onstrate the skill or to perform the job, then the employer is not required to employ the individual.</p>  <p>An employer is obligated to make reason&shy;able accommodations only with respect to the physical or mental limitations of which that employer is aware. While an employer may in&shy;quire whether an employee is having difficulty performing his or her job or participating in the hiring process, it is generally the responsi&shy;bility of the employee to inform the employer that he or she requires accommodation.</p>  <p>Similarly, with respect to testing, an employer is generally required to provide accommo&shy;dations only if it knows in advance that an applicant has a disability that requires accom&shy;modation. Usually, it is the responsibility of the individual with a disability to request any accommodation for a test. The employer can be helpful by informing applicants in advance about any tests to be administered as part of the application process, so that they may re&shy;quest an accommodation, if needed.</p>  <p>It should be noted that the ADA and the Title I regulations prohibit pre-employment in&shy;quiry into a person&rsquo;s disability or the nature of the disability, with one narrow exception. The ADA permits employers to ask indi&shy;viduals with a hidden disability who request accommodations at the application stage to provide reasonable documentation to verify the disability and the need for accommoda&shy;tion. However, the employer may not make further inquiries as to the nature or severity of the disability. For this reason, employers can use psychological tests at the pre-offer state of the hiring process only if these tests are not medical&mdash;that is to say, only if the tests do not provide evidence that would lead to identify&shy;ing a mental disorder.</p>  </div>  <h2>Test Validity Models</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The use of tests for making employment deci&shy;sions is supported by evidence of the tests&rsquo; validity under one or more of the following models:</p>  <ul>  <li>Content validity: the test is a representa&shy;tive sample of performance in some de&shy;fined area of job-related knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristic.</li>  <li>Construct validity: the test is demonstrated to be a measure of a job-relevant character&shy;istic (e.g., reasoning ability).</li>  <li>Criterion-related validity: the test is shown to be statistically related to some criterion of successful job performance.</li>  </ul>  <p>Test accommodations should be made so as to retain the validity of the test for selecting qualified employees.</p>  </div>  <h2>Types of Testing Accommodations</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Testing accommodations will be discussed under three broad categories: testing formats, time limits, and test content.</p>  <p><strong>Testing format. </strong>A change in testing format refers to the use of a different medium or method to present the same information. Test information is usually presented in print in the English language. Therefore, Braille, large print, reader, and audiotape are simply dif&shy;ferent ways of presenting the same informa&shy;tion. In most cases, these formats could be interchanged without a change in the question content or the ability being tested. However, several problem areas exist in the use of differ&shy;ent formats:</p>  <ol>  <li>Long reading passages may be more dif&shy;ficult when presented orally or in other formats for visually impaired applicants. For oral presentation, the test-taker must try to keep the entire passage in memory. In Braille or large print, scanning through the passage is slower than it is with regu&shy;lar print.</li>  <li>Figural material is problematic for people with visual impairments. The embossing of figural material should not be viewed as a simple format change, because the tac&shy;tile sense is quite different from the visual sense.</li>  <li>When readers are used, they should be people who read well and articulate clear&shy;ly, and they should practice reading the test in advance. They should be warned against inadvertently giving clues to the test-taker when they read.</li>  </ol>  <p>It should be noted that changing a test from a printed version into a sign language version is a translation into another language, rather than simply a change of format. It must be done with all of the care that would be taken in translating a test from English into, say, Japanese.</p>  <p><strong>Time limits. </strong>In most cases of accommodated testing it is necessary to change the test&rsquo;s time limits. Often the change in time limits causes a problem in interpreting test results. This problem arises because of the use of &ldquo;speeded power&rdquo; tests. In order to understand this problem, it is necessary to learn a bit of testing terminology.</p>  <p>A pure power test is a test in which everyone has an opportunity to attempt to answer every question, and the scores are based upon how many questions people can answer rather than on how fast they can work. The pure speed test, on the other hand, contains questions of trivial difficulty given with a very short time limit. Scores are based only on how fast people can work. Many tests that are intend&shy;ed to be power tests are actually somewhat speeded because a considerable number of people are unable to attempt every question. On a speeded power test, a person who had unlimited time would have an advantage over people who took it with the regular time limit. However, since many people with disabilities, e.g., Braille users, need extra time to take tests, there is the difficult problem of determining exactly how much extra time should be allot&shy;ted so that the test-taker with a disability is at neither an advantage nor a disadvantage.</p>  <p>The ideal solution to this problem would be to eliminate the use of speeded power tests. If a power test has a liberal time limit, with a completion rate of, say, ninety-five percent of all test-takers, then test-takers with disabilities can be given unlimited time without having an undue advantage. The difficult question of how much extra time to allow would no lon&shy;ger need to be answered.</p>  <p>In the case of existing speed power tests in which the regular time limits cannot be changed, unlimited time may be inappropri&shy;ate. One method of determining appropriate time limits is to conduct empirical studies. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management conducted a study to set time limits for visu&shy;ally impaired and deaf applicants on one of its large volume examinations. It was found that at least double time was needed for visually impaired users of all media to answer ques&shy;tions that consisted of a short reading passage followed by five answer choices. Mathemati&shy;cal questions involving computation required considerably more time than that. Such em&shy;pirical studies are only possible in large-scale programs in which there are many test-takers.</p>  <p>Pure speed tests are used in the employment context to test such skills as perceptual speed and clerical checking. Such tests are clearly inappropriate for use with visually impaired test-takers because all of the media for trans&shy;mitting information are slower, and for some physically impaired applicants, because the physical mechanism for responding (e.g., marking the answer sheet) is slower. The time limit cannot be adjusted on these tests because speed is the factor that is being tested. There&shy;fore, the test user must decide if the speed test should be used with the regular time limit (which is permissible, as noted in the earlier section on legal and regulatory requirements, if the speed factor is necessary to perform an essential job function and the applicant cannot meet the requirement even with reasonable ac&shy;commodation) or if the test should be deleted from the battery and possibly be replaced with another type of assessment. This would be an instance of the last type of test accommoda&shy;tion&mdash;change of test content.</p>  <p><strong>Test content. </strong>In the context of competitive testing for persons with disabilities, changes in test content are not made frequently. However, it is clear that this type of change is a form of accommodation that may be required for compliance with the ADA. Any change in test content would need to be consistent with the validity strategy on which the test was based. For example, substituting one test question for another is easily done under a construct valid&shy;ity model, but might be troublesome under a content validity model.</p>  <p>Changes in test content can be divided for convenience into three types: change in individual test questions, change in the question-type, and change or deletion of a knowledge, skill, or ability (KSA) that is being measured. The first type of change, as mentioned above, is easily done in a construct-valid test. The second type of change&mdash;using a different type of question to test the same ability&mdash;is feasible if another question-type exists and if scoring comparability can be determined.</p>  <p>The interpretive guidance to the EEOC&rsquo;s Title I ADA regulations describes some bold sub&shy;stitutions of methods for measuring the same KSA&rsquo;s, as the following excerpt shows:</p>  <p>&ldquo;Where it is not possible to test in an alterna&shy;tive format, the employer may be required, as a reasonable accommodation, to evaluate the skill to be tested in another manner (e.g., through an interview, or through education, license, or work experience requirements).&rdquo;</p>  <p>This excerpt does not reflect a concern for score comparability. In fact, it is difficult to see how this approach could be used if applicants needed to be rank-ordered on the basis of quantitative scores. &nbsp;</p>  <p>If there is no effective way to test a person with a disability for a certain KSA, and if there is reason to believe that this KSA will not be required on the job by the person, the requirement for measuring this KSA should be changed or deleted.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodation for Specific Disabilities</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The following is a brief listing of the types of testing accommodations that are appropriate for test-takers with different disabilities.</p>  <p>For test-takers with visual impairments, tests must be presented in appropriate formats, such as Braille, large print, and audiotape. Time limits must be extended for all of these media, and speed tests are inappropriate. Within the context of changing test materi&shy;als into different formats, certain types of test material may be problematic, as noted earlier. In addition, the test-taker will probably need accommodation or assistance in marking answers.</p>  <p>For test-takers who have physical impairments that affect use of the hands, the principal test accommodation is the adjustment of test time limits and the avoidance of speed tests. In addition, accessible test sites, the assistance of a test administrator in turning pages and marking answers, and extra rest breaks may be required.</p>  <p>Among hearing impaired test-takers, only those who are deaf need extensive testing accommodations. For the majority of prelin&shy;gually deaf persons, that is, persons who lost their hearing before acquiring speech, verbal tests are not good measures of any ability. For most pre-lingual deaf people, English is a sec&shy;ond language and the native language is sign language. (Of course, there are exceptions to this rule; some prelingually deaf people have very good English skills.) Therefore, as a general rule, verbal tests cannot be used effectively with most deaf test-takers to test anything except verbal ability. Tests that are completely nonverbal, however, do not pose a problem. Test instructions should be given very carefully, with the use of sign language or demonstration, and time limits should be ex&shy;plained clearly. Extra time should be allowed on power tests that include verbal material.</p>  <p>Individuals with specific learning disabilities now constitute the largest group that requires testing accommodations. The specific tasks that are affected by learning disabilities vary widely, so it is difficult to generalize about testing accommodations. Accommodations will need to be arranged on a case-by-case ba&shy;sis for applicants with specific learning disabil&shy;ities. The most frequently used accommoda&shy;tions are the allowance of additional time for power tests and reconsideration of speed tests in areas of specific weakness. For example, a test-taker who has a specific learning disability that affects numerical computation might be screened out by a speeded test of computation. Under the ADA, it would be inappropriate to use that test unless it tested an essential job function that the test-taker could not perform with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Mary Anne Nester, Ph.D.',NULL,80,'U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service  Washington, DC',NULL,'1997; July, 2000',NULL),(19,'Psychiatric Disabilities','Employing and Accommodating Workers  with Psychiatric Disabilities',4,'<h2>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Individuals with Psychiatric Disabilities</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Some people are surprised to learn that the ADA covers individuals with psychiatric, as well as physical, disabilities. This is consistent with Sections 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the federal nondiscrimination statute which preceded the ADA. In fact, 13% of those filing employment discrimination claims under the ADA describe themselves as having emotional or psychiatric impairments, making it the second most common type of disability cited in all claims to date -- and exceeded only by charges from people with back impairments, who comprise 18% of total claims.</p>  <p>ADA coverage is limited to individuals with \"physical or mental impairments\" that \"substantially limit one or more major life activities when using a mitigating measure.\"<sup>1</sup> When a mitigating measure applies, the law also considers any remaining limitation and medication side effects. The ADA also protects from discrimination individuals with a record of a disability and individuals regarded as having a disability. Thus individuals who do not currently have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities would still fall within the scope of ADA coverage if a covered entity discriminates against them based on a record of a disability or if they are regarded as being disabled.</p>  <p>Individuals with psychiatric diagnoses such as major depression, bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness), and schizophrenia may be covered, depending on how the condition affects their functioning. Individuals with other psychiatric conditions (such as anxiety, personality, dissociative, or post-traumatic stress disorders) may also be included in the ADA definition.</p>  <p>The ADA does not usually cover impairments that only last for a brief period of time or do not significantly restrict an individual\'s ability to perform a major life activity. For example, individuals with mild or short-term mental health problems usually will not meet the ADA\'s definition of disability.<sup>2</sup></p>  <p>There is much debate about preferred terminology for referring to individuals with psychiatric disabilities. Some other commonly used terms are \"person with a mental health disability,\" \"mental health consumer,\" \"person with a mental illness,\" \"mental health client,\" or \"psychiatric survivor.\"</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup><br /> Sutton v.

A diagnosis of mental retardation is chiefly characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning, as well as difficulties with certain skills of daily life. By definition, mental retardation begins before the age of 18.</p>  <p>In contrast, the intellectual functioning of persons with psychiatric disabilities varies as it does across the general population. The symptoms of mental illness may include emotional disturbances, disordered thinking, or perceptual difficulties. Mental illness may develop at any age, from childhood through later life. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have a high rate of onset during early adulthood. Therefore, many individuals with psychiatric disabilities enter or complete college before first experiencing symptoms.</p>  <p><i>Myth #3: People with psychiatric disabilities are likely to be violent.</i> Upon learning that an applicant has a history of psychiatric treatment, some employers may expect that the individual is likely to become violent. This myth is reinforced by portrayals of people with mental illnesses in movies, television, and the news media as frequently and randomly violent.</p>  <p>According to the National Mental Health Association, \"Violent acts committed by persons with mental illness represent a small fraction of the violence perpetrated in our country, yet these acts are frequently highly sensationalized by the media and lead to the continued stigmatization of persons with mental illness.\"<sup>5</sup></p>  <p><i>Myth #4: Recovery from mental illness is not possible.</i> For many decades, people with mental illnesses were separated from the rest of society through institutionalization in mental hospitals. Mental illness was thought to be permanent and untreatable.</p>  <p>Public policies began shifting in the late 1950\'s and early 1960\'s as we realized that hundreds of thousands of American citizens were being confined unnecessarily. Medications were discovered that helped to alleviate the symptoms of mental illness, and there was a gradual evolution toward the provision of treatment and rehabilitation services in the community. Long-term studies have shown that the majority of people with mental illnesses show genuine improvement over time and lead stable, productive lives.</p>  <p>The success of prominent figures with mental illnesses has helped to inform the public that healing and recovery are indeed possible. Psychologist &amp; Professor Kay Redfield Jamison has written several popular books about her own experience with bipolar disorder. A book by Kathy Conkrite entitled, \"On the Edge of Darkness\" features personal accounts by Mike Wallace, Joan Rivers, William Styron, Kitty Dukakis, and others about their struggle with and success in overcoming depression.</p>  <p><i>Myth #5: People with psychiatric disabilities can\'t tolerate stress on the job.</i> This myth over-simplifies the rather complex human response to stress. People with a variety of medical conditions - including cardiovascular disease, multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders - may find their symptoms exacerbated by high levels of stress. But the sources of personal and job-related stress vary substantially from individual to individual. Some people find an unstructured schedule to be very stressful, while others struggle with a regimented work flow. Some people thrive on public visibility or high levels of social contact, while others need solitude to focus and be productive. Of course, workers with psychiatric disabilities vary, too, in their responses to stressors on the job.</p>  <p>All jobs are stressful in some regard. Productivity is maximized when there is a good match between the employee\'s needs and his or her working conditions - whether or not the individual has a psychiatric disability.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup><br /> Kessler, R.C., et al.

Further, the ADA prohibits employers from asking applicants if they have psychiatric disabilities before making a job offer. Examples of pre-employment questions not allowed under the ADA include the following: Have you ever been hospitalized? Have you had a major illness in the last five years? Have you ever been treated by a psychiatrist or psychologist? How many days were you absent from work because of illness last year? Are you taking any prescribed drugs?</p>  <p>In order to determine whether applicants are qualified, the screening process should identify the essential functions of the job, then seek evidence that the potential employee has the needed skills, work experience, education or other qualifications.</p>  <p>Given these guidelines, employers are unlikely to know if an applicant has a psychiatric disability unless he or she chooses to discuss it. For example, a worker might decide to disclose that he/she has a disability in order to request a workplace accommodation. But some workers with psychiatric disabilities don\'t require accommodations. Applicants and employees are often deterred from discussing their disabilities with employers by the very severe stigma associated with psychiatric disorders in our society. Disclosure is a personal decision on the part of the worker that involves many factors including trust, comfort with others in the workplace, job security, and the perceived open-mindedness and support of the immediate supervisor.</p>  </div>  <h2>How might psychiatric disabilities affect an individual\'s functioning in the work place?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>It is impossible to generalize about the characteristics of all people with psychiatric disabilities. When asked how their mental illness affects their functioning on the job, some workers with psychiatric disabilities cite difficulty maintaining concentration. Workers who take medications to control their psychiatric symptoms may experience side effects such as hand tremors, excessive thirst, or blurred vision. Some individuals report difficulty in focusing on multiple tasks simultaneously, particularly amid noise and distractions.</p>  <p>Of course, the strengths and weaknesses of each applicant or employee must be assessed individually, regardless of the presence of a disability. The worker\'s ability to perform a job will depend on his or her work experience, training, and skills, not merely the presence or absence of a psychiatric diagnosis.</p>  </div>  <h2>What types of accommodations might be helpful for workers with psychiatric disabilities?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>This is a frequently-asked question. The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations has surveyed both federal government and private employers regarding their policies and practices on the ADA and accommodations. In both studies, respondents identified further information about accommodations for persons with psychiatric disabilities as a significant ongoing need (69 percent of Federal respondents and 65 percent of non-federal respondents).<sup>6</sup></p>  <p>Good management practices will produce many of the workplace accommodations needed by people with psychiatric disabilities. Like all employees, workers with psychiatric disabilities may benefit from supervisors who:</p>  <ul>  <li>approach each employee with an open mind about his/her strengths and abilities,</li>  <li>clearly delineate expectations for performance,</li>  <li>deliver positive feedback along with criticisms of performance in a timely and constructive fashion,</li>  <li>are available regularly during the workday for consultation with employees,</li>  <li>demonstrate flexibility and fairness in administering policies and work assignments.</li>  </ul>  <p>In addition to high quality supervision, some workers with psychiatric disabilities may benefit from one or more of the following accommodations:</p>  <ul>  <li>schedules which incorporate flex-time, part-time positions or job sharing, time off for scheduled medical appointments or support groups,</li>  <li>the use of break time according to individual needs rather than a fixed schedule,</li>  <li>physical arrangements (such as room partitions or an enclosed office space) to reduce noise or visual distractions,</li>  <li>extending additional leave to allow a worker to keep his or her job after a hospitalization,</li>  <li>allowing workers to phone supportive friends, family members, or professionals during the work day,</li>  <li>joint meetings between the employee, supervisor, and job coach or other employment service provider.</li>  </ul>  <p>These are only a few examples of the many accommodations that have been successfully implemented for workers with psychiatric disabilities. Effective accommodations for workers with disabilities are always determined on a case-by-case basis. The Job Accommodation Network at (800) ADA-WORK provides free consultation to employers and individuals with disabilities about workplace accommodations. In addition, reference materials about accommodating workers with psychiatric disabilities are available from the organizations listed below.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>6</sup><br /> Bruy&egrave;re, S.

Achieving this goal requires employers to move beyond stereotypes and to assess the qualifications and performance of workers with psychiatric disabilities on an individual basis. Employees with psychiatric disabilities can bring unique skills and sensitivities that significantly add to the quality and diversity of the workplace.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Laura L. Mancuso, MS, CRC',NULL,97,'Goleta, California',NULL,'1994; 2000',NULL),(20,'Reasonable Accommodations','Reasonable Accommodation Under the ADA',2,'<h2>What is Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires employers to provide reasonable accommodation for qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment. Potential reasonable accommoda&shy;tions include making existing facilities ac-accessible, job-restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, assistive technology, providing aides or qualified in&shy;terpreters, changing tests or policies, and reassignment to a vacant position. The reasonable accommodation obligation also extends to the benefits and privileges of employment, such as employer-sponsored training, services, and social func&shy;tions. Generally, the individual with a disability must inform the employer that an accommodation is needed, and an employer is not required to provide accom&shy;modation for any disability of which it is not aware.</p>  <p>Employers are required to provide reasonable accommodation only to individu&shy;als with a disability who are qualified. Under the ADA, an individuals with a disability is qualified if s/he satisfies the job-related requirements of the position held or desired and can perform the &ldquo;essential functions&rdquo; of such position, with or without reasonable accommodation. The employer identifies the job&rsquo;s es&shy;sential functions; job descriptions prepared before an individual is interviewed or selected for a position are considered evidence of a job&rsquo;s essential functions.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">If the individual cannot perform an essential function, even with accommodation, the indi&shy;vidual is not considered &ldquo;a qualified individu&shy;al with a disability&rdquo; under the law.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The employer should confer with the employ&shy;ee regarding the type of accommodation that will enable the employee to perform the essen&shy;tial functions of the position. Together, they should evaluate the nature of the employee&rsquo;s physical or mental limitations in order to de&shy;termine one or more effective potential accom&shy;modations.</p>  <p>Employers need not provide accommodations that pose an \"undue hardship\" (defined as significantly difficult or expensive). In deter&shy;mining whether an accommodation poses an undue hardship, employers should examine the nature and net cost of the accommodation, the overall financial resources of the facility and the larger business entity, and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the business. Accommodations of a personal nature that are used both on and off the job (such as a guide dog for a visually-impaired employee or a wheelchair) would not be the employer&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>  <p>The ADA neither requires employers to create a new job for the person with the disability, nor to reallocate essential functions to another worker. An employer may be required to re&shy;structure a job, however, by reallocating non&shy;essential, marginal job functions. For example, the Postal Service refused to promote a hear&shy;ing-impaired secretary because she could not answer the telephone. The court ordered the Postal Service to promote the individual, not&shy;ing that several other secretaries were avail&shy;able to answer the telephone, and that simply because telephone answering was considered a low status assignment did not make it an es&shy;sential function of the secretary&rsquo;s job.</p>  <p>Some courts and the EEOC have taken the position that the location where the work is performed is another policy that may have to be modified as a reasonable accommodation for certain jobs, so long as the accommoda&shy;tion is effective and does not pose an undue hardship. The EEOC has noted that certain jobs such as a food server or cashier can only be performed at a work site, while other jobs such as a telemarketer or proofreader could be done at home. The EEOC has stated that certain considerations are relevant to the de&shy;termination of whether a job can be performed at home, including supervision and the need to work with equipment that cannot be repli&shy;cated at home. The courts that have rejected working at home as a reasonable accommoda&shy;tion focus upon evidence that personal con&shy;tact, interaction and coordination are needed for the position at issue.</p>  <p>Employers who fear that accommodating a worker with a disability will lower the morale of coworkers will not find this a helpful de&shy;fense to an ADA charge. Nor will the concern that coworkers or customers will not wish to associate with an individual with a disability be an appropriate reason to deny such an individual employment. Regarding the finan&shy;cial burden of accommodating an employee or applicant with a disability, a study beginning in 2004 revealed that 56% of accommodations cost nothing to implement, while most of the remaining accommodations involved a one-time cost of approximately $600. Moreover, tax credits help alleviate the cost of imple&shy;menting accommodations such as the removal of architectural barriers, the targeting of jobs for individuals with disabilities, or the provi&shy;sion of assistive technology or interpreters to workers with disabilities.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodating a Worker with a Disability</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The accommodation process begins before the disabled worker is hired (or identified, if it is a current employee who becomes disabled after being hired). Written job descriptions prepared before advertising or interviewing applicants are evidence of whether particular job functions are essential, but other evidence, such as what previous or current holders of the job actually do, is also relevant. Job de&shy;scriptions should be reviewed to ensure that they include the essential functions of each job, particularly with regard to physical require&shy;ments. Statements such as &ldquo;all incumbents must perform all functions of the position,&rdquo; or &ldquo;there is no light duty in this department&rdquo; are not determinative of whether a reasonable ac&shy;commodation must be provided.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Recruiters or interviewers must be trained regarding what inquiries are permissible under the ADA. At the pre-offer stage, em&shy;ployers may ask about an applicant&rsquo;s ability to perform specific job-related functions, but generally may not ask an applicant whether s/ he needs a reasonable accommodation for the job. An exception exists, however, if the em&shy;ployer knows that an applicant has a disability -- either because it is obvious or because the applicant has voluntarily disclosed the infor&shy;mation -- and could reasonably believe that the applicant will need a reasonable accom&shy;modation to perform specific job functions. In this circumstance, if the applicant replies that that an accommodation is needed, the employer may inquire as to what type of ac&shy;commodation is required. An employer may require non-medical examinations and may, of course, ask other questions that are not disability-related.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">After the employer extends a conditional offer of employment, it now may require a medical examination or make disability-related inqui&shy;ries if all entering employees are subject to the same exam or inquiry. An employer also may inquire whether applicants will need reason&shy;able accommodation related to anything con&shy;nected to the job, including access to benefits and privileges of employment, as long as all entering employees in the same job category are asked this question. The employer may, of course, make any inquiry at this stage of the hiring process that would be allowed in the pre-offer stage (i.e., an inquiry regarding whether an applicant requires accommodation with respect to a disability of which the em&shy;ployer is aware).</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Finally, during the employment stage, em&shy;ployers may con-duct medical examinations and make disability-related inquiries of em&shy;ployees provided that those investigations are job-related and consistent with business necessity. Whenever an examination is used, whether during the post-offer stage or the em&shy;ployment stage, the exclusionary criterion also must be job-related and consistent with business necessity. If the employer either fails to hire or fires an individual due to the results of an examination, it must show that the skill be&shy;ing tested is an essential job function that the individual cannot perform without reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>The employer must keep any medical informa&shy;tion obtained confidential. This means that the employer must collect and maintain the information on separate forms and keep it in separate medical files. The employer may disclose the information only to persons and entities specified in the ADA.</p>  <p>Employers may use tests to determine job qualifications. However, qualification stan&shy;dards, tests or other selection criteria that screen out an individual with a disability or a class of individuals with disabilities will vio&shy;late the ADA unless shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity. Even if this showing can be made, an employer must consider whether the criteria can be met or job performance accomplished with the provision of reasonable accommodation. In addition, tests must be administered to an ap&shy;plicant or employee with a disability in a way that ensures that the test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor is being tested, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual or speaking skills of the person, unless these skills are what is being tested.</p>  </div>  <h2>Reasonable Accommodation and Safety</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Some employers are concerned that a worker with a disability could be a safety hazard, either to herself or to co-workers or customers. The law takes this concern into account, but only if it is founded upon current medical or other evidence that the individual is a &ldquo;direct threat&rdquo; to herself or others because of the na&shy;ture of the job and the specific characteristics of that individual&rsquo;s disability.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">In determining whether an individual with a disability poses a direct threat, including an individual with a contagious disease, the fac&shy;tors to be considered include:</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">1. the duration of the risk;</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">2. the nature and severity of the potential harm;</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">3. the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and</p>  <p class=\"Pa5\">4. the imminence of the potential harm.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Even if the person is found to pose a sig&shy;nificant risk of substantial harm, part of the reasonable accommodation determination is an analysis of whether the individual can be accommodated in a way that either eliminates the threat or reduces it to an acceptable level. For example, in a case involving an epileptic shoe salesman, a court noted that, even if the salesman posed a danger because of the risk of epileptic seizures, reasonable accommodations such as the removal of stock from high shelves so that the salesman would not have to climb ladders would eliminate that threat.</p>  <p>In general, blanket exclusions of particular conditions are difficult to justify, especially if the employer does not per-form an individual&shy;ized assessment of the individual being ex&shy;cluded. Instead, the employer should obtain individualized medical information about the limitations posed by the worker&rsquo;s disability and the probable harm that the individual&rsquo;s specific physical or psychological problems will pose with respect to the position in ques&shy;tion. For ex-ample, a court concluded that a diabetic police recruit did pose a direct threat because he had suffered two episodes on duty in which he became dysfunctional and disori&shy;ented, but in cases where employers excluded all diabetics from law enforcement jobs or driving jobs on the ground that any case of diabetes posed a direct threat, that blanket exclusion was overly broad.</p>  </div>  <h2>Reasonable Accommodation and Worker Misconduct</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA protects individuals with mental as well as physical disabilities, and the reason&shy;able accommodation requirement applies in the same way for both kinds of disabilities. However, employers may hold individu&shy;als with disabilities to the same performance and conduct standards as other workers. If a worker engages in misconduct that warrants discipline under the employer&rsquo;s policy, even if the conduct is related to the individual&rsquo;s disability, the employer may discipline that worker.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The timing of employee misconduct with re&shy;spect to any accommodation request is impor&shy;tant. If an employee requests accommodation prior to engaging in misconduct, e.g., leave to attend therapy sessions, the employer should allow reasonable accommodation that does not impose an undue hardship. On the other hand, if the employee engages in misconduct prior to requesting the accommodation, the employer may impose the appropriate disci&shy;pline. This may include discharge, depending on the employer\'s disciplinary policy and the nature of the misconduct involved. If the em&shy;ployer has a policy of progressive discipline, the employer may impose discipline short of discharge and then provide an accommoda&shy;tion that would enable the employee to meet the conduct standards.</p>  <p>Off-duty misconduct may also be grounds for discharge or discipline, even if the worker asserts that the disability &ldquo;caused&rdquo; the mis&shy;conduct. In most cases that have reached the courts, the misconduct was related to alcohol or drug abuse, and the employer was able to demonstrate that retaining the individual would impose an undue hardship because the job itself requires the individual to dem&shy;onstrate good judgment or to be law-abiding (such as in the case of a police officer or an FBI agent).</p>  <p>Employees whose excessive absences or tardi&shy;ness create problems for the employer are not necessarily protected even if the attendance problems are related to the disability. How&shy;ever, the employer must consider whether a reasonable accommodation (such as a differ&shy;ent work schedule, additional paid or unpaid time off, or working at home) is possible and whether such an accommodation would con&shy;stitute an undue hardship.</p>  <p>Employers should train their staff about the general requirements of the ADA, with partic&shy;ular emphasis on defining the essential func&shy;tions of each position and the accommodation requirement. Learning to assess the individual first, and the disability second, working with the individual and his or her counselor, medical professional, or other knowledge&shy;able persons in fashioning the appropriate-ate accommodation, and responding to requests to review the effectiveness of the accommoda&shy;tion will very likely satisfy the demands of the ADA, the practical needs of the individual with a disability, and the employer&rsquo;s need for a productive and committed workforce.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'The original brochure was written by Barbara A.

An injury to the spinal cord interferes with messages between the brain and the body and results in paralysis and sensory loss below the level of the injury. The location at which the cord is injured and the severity of the injury determines the physical limitations the person will have. Individuals with SCI have near-normal life expectancy and they can and do work in a wide variety of employment settings.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodating Individuals with SCI</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The physical limitations imposed by a SCI can sometimes interfere with performance of job tasks. Job accommodations, however, can solve many task performance problems and enable the person to be a capable and productive employee.</p>  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities so that they may 1) participate in the job application process; 2) perform the essential functions of the job; and 3) enjoy equal benefits and privileges of employment.</p>  <p>Reasonable accommodation related to job performance can take many forms, including: making the workplace accessible; reallocating marginal functions that the individual cannot perform because of the disability or changing when or how any job function is performed; part time or modified work schedules; the use of leave when necessary; obtaining special equipment or modifying current equipment; providing assistants to help with job-related tasks; providing reserved parking; and allowing the employee to utilize equipment, aids or services that the employer is not required to provide, such as a service animal.</p>  <p>Employers are not required to provide accommodations that will pose an undue hardship. Undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. Undue hardship is evaluated by assessing various factors, including the nature and net cost of the accommodation; the number of employees, type of operations and financial resources of the facility and the larger business entity of which it may be a part; and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.</p>  </div>  <h2>Considerations in the Hiring Process</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, employers must make reasonable accommodation for a qualified individual with a known physical or mental disability. With SCI, the disability is physical and is usually apparent. The applicant will most likely be using a manual or powered wheelchair or walking aides. The presence of the disability, however, should not be the focus of the employee selection process. Rather the process should center on whether the education, experience and skills of the applicant meet the job requirements and whether he or she can perform the documented essential functions with or without a reasonable accommodation. The employer might start by sharing and discussing the job description. A job description should include the essential functions of the job, marginal or peripheral functions, minimum qualifications, job location and equipment to be used in job performance.</p>  <p>The employer may ask all applicants whether they can perform any or all job functions, including whether they can perform job functions \"with or without reasonable accommodation.\" Some individuals, however, have additional problems as a result of their spinal cord injury that may be less apparent. These include pain, poor heat tolerance and fatigue. If an applicant\'s disability is either obvious or has been disclosed by the person, an employer may ask the applicant to describe or demonstrate how s/he would perform a particular function. This can also be asked if the employer could reasonably believe that the person will not be able to perform the function. Any request for a reasonable accommodation, however, will generally come from the individual.</p>  <p>The applicant with a SCI may require some form of accommodation in order to participate in the employee selection process. A few examples of accommodations that may be helpful during this process are:</p>  <ul>  <li>mailing an application to those who request it</li>  <li>offering the services of someone to assist in completing the application</li>  <li>having disabled parking nearby</li>  <li>use an adjustable height table or desk to provide clearance for a person using a wheelchair</li>  <li>relocating an interview to an accessible location or better yet, removing physical barriers by installing a ramp, door opener or providing wide passage and doorways</li>  <li>review the physical accessibility of your interviewing space. Ensure access to your parking, building, and interview room/location?</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Solving Common Work Issues</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The type of work problems (if any) that an employee with a SCI may experience will depend on the individual\'s level of injury, the physical requirements of the job and the work environment. Some accommodations may be needed for a person to perform successfully the essential functions of the job. It is quite possible that the employee will know the type of accommodation that is needed. Accommodations are usually inexpensive, contrary to what many people believe. Studies have shown that the majority of accommodations cost less than $500<sup>1</sup> and many cost nothing. Also, there are frequently several different accommodations that may solve a problem. Examples of common work issues and how they have been solved are:</p>  <p><i>Standard Desk too low for Wheelchair Access</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Remove center drawer</li>  <li>Raise desk with wooden blocks</li>  <li>Purchase higher or adjustable height desk</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Pedestal desk center opening too narrow for wheelchair access</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Purchase a table</li>  <li>Purchase an L-shaped desk with open clearance for wheelchair</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Holding a telephone receiver difficult due to limited hand or arm function</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Provide a speakerphone</li>  <li>Purchase a telephone headset</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Using a standard keyboard/mouse with impaired hand or arm function</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Provide a keyboard drawer at appropriate height</li>  <li>Provide a trackball</li>  <li>Purchase hardware or software that provides for alternative access such as voice activation or using Morse code.</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Managing papers difficult with limited hand function</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Book holders</li>  <li>Catalogue racks</li>  <li>Copy holders</li>  <li>Table top vertical files</li>  <li>Lazy Susan table top holders</li>  <li>Automatic page turners</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Physical access into the facility</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Access to reserved parking for disabled</li>  <li>Accessible route from parking into facility</li>  <li>Maintenance of accessible features: firm and stable path of travel, snow removal, elevator or lift maintenance</li>  <li>Lever hardware on doors</li>  <li>Power doors for heavy doors</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Physical access within facility</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Widen narrow doorways to 32\", or add offset hinges which can add 1-1.5 inches of clearance</li>  <li>Maintain at least 36\" clear path of travel through furniture, files, and other objects</li>  <li>Keep most frequently used materials and information on lower shelves/tables and do not use top drawers of file cabinets if person is unable to reach them</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Bathroom access issues</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Lowered mirrors and paper towel dispensers</li>  <li>Knee clearance for sinks and wrapped pipes</li>  <li>Combine two stalls into one larger one</li>  <li>Add elevated toilet or toilet seat</li>  <li>Add grab bars</li>  </ul>  <p><i>Morning routine for personal care may necessitate changes in work schedules</i></p>  <ul>  <li>Flexible schedule</li>  <li>Telecommute part time</li>  <li>Part-time employment</li>  </ul>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup><br /> Job Accomodation Network, <i> Accomodation Benefit/ Cost Data 1992-1999</i>. http://www.jan.wvu.edu/media/Stats/BenCosts0799.html</div>  </div>  <h2>Retaining Employees</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Everyone experiences functional changes as they age. For individuals with SCI, as well as other disabilities, these changes may occur prematurely and affect job performance. Functional changes can include pain in upper extremity joints, fatigue, muscle weakness and pain and stiffness. The impact of changes on work may be overlooked for a while because the changes may occur gradually.. Accommodations that may enable the employee to begin working may also allow the employee to continue to be a successful, productive, employee. Health and wellness for employees with SCI are vitally important to maintain good health and any company provided programs should be reviewed in order to assure their accessibility for all employees.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Nancy Somerville, BS & Dorothy Wilson, FAOTA, OTR',NULL,127,'Rancho Los Amigos Aging with a Disability RRTC',NULL,'August, 2000',NULL),(22,'Mediation','Mediation and Title I of the ADA',2,'<h2>What is Mediation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Mediation, a form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), is a process in which a neutral third party (the mediator) assists two or more disputants in finding a mutually acceptable solution to their conflict.

That is, they all use a system of advo&shy;cates (lawyers) who represent their respective clients&rsquo; cases to a third-party decision-maker whose role is similar to that of a judge. Pri&shy;vate judging is identical to standard litiga&shy;tion except that it uses former judges to hear cases in private courtrooms. In arbitration, the arbitrator hears evidence from both sides and renders a decision that is often binding on those parties. In neutral expert evaluation, the attorneys for each party present their cases to a third attorney who has many years of expe&shy;rience in the area of law at issue. This expert attorney renders an informal opinion, rather than a binding arbitration decision, that em&shy;phasizes the strengths and weaknesses of each party&rsquo;s case with the purpose of giving the parties a realistic basis for out-of-court settle&shy;ment. Similarly, when parties choose to turn their case over to a screening panel, they allow that panel to evaluate their case at an early stage in the litigation process with the goal of reaching a settlement.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Many courts encourage ADR (including me&shy;diation), because it can save the parties both time and money. In some jurisdictions, at&shy;torneys are ethically required to inform their clients about ADR options.</p>  <h2>Why is Mediation Becoming So Popular?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Mediation&rsquo;s growing popularity can be at&shy;tributed, in part, to the fact that it is voluntary, confidential, expeditious, and far less costly than litigation. The process also leaves the parties in control of the outcome. Further&shy;more, participating in mediation does not require the parties to waive statutory or due process rights, and an agreement to mediate leaves the parties free to pursue other courses of action at any time they wish. Mediation also allows people to be heard and permits the parties to be as creative as they wish in formu&shy;lating an agreement that will work for them.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Many organizations are implementing me&shy;diation or mediation techniques in-house to resolve employment disputes at the earliest possible point. Through mediation, prob&shy;lems often are resolved before they negatively impact office peace and the productive func&shy;tioning of employees. As noted above, it also helps to avoid litigation and its associated costs.</p>  <h2>How Does Mediation Differ from Litigation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Mediation sharply contrasts with the adver&shy;sarial processes of litigation or arbitration and, at least theoretically, decreases the hostility that can result from both. Mediation neither judges guilt or innocence, nor decides who is right or wrong. Rather, its goal is to give the parties the opportunity to:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>(1) vent and defuse feelings</p>  <p>(2) clear up misunderstandings</p>  <p>(3) determine underlying interests or concerns</p>  <p>(4) find areas of agreement</p>  <p>(5) incorporate these areas into solutions de&shy;vised by the parties themselves</p>  <p>Litigation usually asks the question: &ldquo;Who is most at fault and how much should s/he lose?&rdquo; Mediation asks much different types of ques&shy;tions, such as: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting a divorce&mdash;how shall we continue to parent our children?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;The car that was sold was defective&mdash;what will we do about this transportation prob&shy;lem?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;What needs to be done to improve our working relationship or correct the work environment (e.g., when impaired by discrimi&shy;natory comments or actions)?&rdquo;</p>  <p>By focusing on both parties&rsquo; interests, rather than just their stated positions, mediation can often lead to win/win solutions, where both parties are satisfied with the settlement that they have personally helped to craft.</p>  <h2>What Does the Mediator Do?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>A mediator, unlike a judge, a hearing exam&shy;iner, or an arbitrator, has no legal power to render a judgment or award. The mediator is also not an advocate for any one side, nor is the mediator acting as a therapist or counselor (although the parties may perceive the me&shy;diation process to be therapeutic). Rather, a mediator is a neutral third party who helps the parties talk out their problems by facilitating discussions and enhancing communications. Both parties must have trust in the mediator&rsquo;s neutrality; a mediator&rsquo;s effectiveness depends on the parties&rsquo; trust.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>The best mediators have good common sense, the power of persuasion, and skills to facilitate problem solving. A facilitative mediator re&shy;mains totally neutral and rarely makes recom&shy;mendations that reveal how s/he feels about a dispute. Instead, the mediator tries to recon&shy;cile opposing points of view by searching for common ground. While mediator styles vary tremendously, in any mediation, a mediator will typically:</p>  <p>&bull; Explain the process and develop an at&shy;mosphere conducive to problem-solving negotiations.</p>  <p>&bull; Give each party a chance to tell its side of the story, to vent emotions, and to feel like it has been heard by both the mediator and the other side.</p>  <p>&bull; Gather all the information available about issues and the interests of both parties by listening and asking questions in both joint and separate sessions.</p>  <p>&bull; Help identify issues and find common ground.</p>  <p>&bull; Encourage the parties to brainstorm and create options.</p>  <p>&bull; Help the parties evaluate and narrow the options, including helping the parties make rational decisions regarding whether to reach an agreement or pursue a legal claim.</p>  <p>&bull; Assist, if requested, in drafting a memo&shy;randum of understanding containing the major points of agreement (final agree&shy;ments typically would be handled by counsel in complex cases; in simple cases, such as small claims court disputes, the mediator may draft the final agreement).</p>  <h2>How Can My Business Use Mediation to Prevent Litigation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Although some organizations employ in-house mediators or conflict resolution special&shy;ists to whom employees can turn for help in resolving disputes, more commonly, human resources (H.R.) professionals are trained to use mediation techniques in the every day course of dealing with conflicts among em&shy;ployees. Many of the mediation techniques discussed in the preceding section are used by in-house conflict resolution specialists and H.R. professionals (sometimes one and the same) as they assist employees and/or supervi&shy;sors in trying to resolve disputes.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Mediation techniques may be used in an informal, non-structured way that is simply termed a discussion or series of discussions. Alternatively, the parties may be invited to sit down and mediate their dispute with an in-house person serving as the mediator. When no in-house person with mediation skills is available, the employer sometimes will con&shy;tract with an outside mediator to sit down and work with the parties to resolve their disputes.</p>  <p>Issues appropriate for mediation may range from an interpersonal dispute that is not legal&shy;ly cognizable (two employees who just don&rsquo;t get along and are disturbing office peace), to a clear cut legal claim that has not yet been filed. In general, it is advisable to discuss and medi&shy;ate problems as soon as possible before they intensify or escalate to the point of litigation.</p>  <p>In cases where there has been a legal viola&shy;tion, a written mediation agreement with relief would typically be drafted and signed (see discussion below). In other cases, the most important part of the mediation is to air the is&shy;sues.</p>  <h2>What Can Be Agreed to in a Mediated Settlement?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Creative resolution is a hallmark of media&shy;tion. In a mediated agreement involving a legal claim, the parties can agree to a solution that would be available in court as well as to a solution beyond what a judge could order.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>In an employment discrimination case, the following remedies typically are obtained by going to court (depending on the issues in the case):</p>  <p>&bull; Back pay or front pay</p>  <p>&bull; Attorney&rsquo;s fees</p>  <p>&bull; Compensatory and/or punitive damages</p>  <p>&bull; Injunctive relief, including reinstatement, promotion, transfer, etc.</p>  <p>&bull; Posting notices</p>  <p>By contrast, the following solutions are not common to litigation but are available through mediation:</p>  <p>&bull; Structured payments, annuities</p>  <p>&bull; Confidentiality</p>  <p>&bull; Outplacement services</p>  <p>&bull; Training program at workplace</p>  <p>&bull; Apology</p>  <p>&bull; Revision of employment records</p>  <p>&bull; Publicity releases</p>  <p>&bull; Employment references</p>  <p>&bull; Health care and benefits continuation</p>  <p>&bull; Stock options</p>  <p>&bull; Donations to charity</p>  <p>&bull; No reapplication provision/rehire agree&shy;ment, in the event of breach of settlement</p>  <h2>What is Different About ADA Mediations?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>All of the basic principles and advantages of mediation apply equally to ADA mediations. There are also a number of additional con&shy;siderations with ADA mediations, however, starting with ensuring that an individual with a disability is provided with any accommoda&shy;tion necessary for him/her to participate in the mediation. Some of the special considerations that may come into play during ADA media&shy;tions will be discussed below.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Early Mediation When Agreement Cannot Be Reached On Accommodation Issues</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The Equal Employment Opportunity Com&shy;mission (EEOC), which enforces ADA Title I, strongly encourages the parties to engage in an &ldquo;interactive process&rdquo; when determining whether and what reasonable accommodation is required to enable an applicant or employee to perform the essential functions of a job held or desired. This interactive process often results in the parties agreeing on an effective accommodation, perhaps with the help of an outside expert. When the parties cannot reach agreement, mediation may be a beneficial next step. An in-house conflict resolution specialist or H.R. person with mediation skills may be able to facilitate discussions, either informally or by conducting a full mediation with the ap&shy;plicant or employee and the employer repre&shy;sentative responsible for the accommodation decision. At times, it may be necessary to turn to an outside mediator if the in-house person is not considered to be sufficiently neutral.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>What Are the New ADA Mediation Guidelines?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>In 2000, a National Work Group comprised of 12 mediation practitioners, trainers, and administrators developed ADA Mediation Guidelines.2 These guidelines set forth valu&shy;able information and guidance on the media&shy;tion of cases arising under the ADA, as well as under other disability civil rights statutes, such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, and com&shy;parable state and local civil rights laws. The guidelines can also be applied to the media&shy;tion of non-ADA cases, such as commercial or family disputes, that involve a party with a disability.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>A copy of the ADA Mediation Guidelines is available at http://www.cardozojcr.com/ada.html</p>  <h2>How Do I Choose A Mediator for an ADA Case?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>You want to choose a mediator who is compe&shy;tent to mediate the type of workplace problem at issue. The Guidelines take the position that the mediator not only should be knowledge&shy;able about the mediation process but also about the subject matter of the dispute. In general, mediators should have knowledge of disabilities, disability access, and disability law, including general ADA case law develop&shy;ments and guidance documents issued by the regulatory agencies. A mediator knowledge&shy;able about the status of the law will be able to work with the parties effectively in exploring the range of settlement options and will know if the parties are making informed decisions and enforceable agreements. A mediator may be competent to mediate ADA cases as a result of ADA mediation training, experience doing ADA mediations, legal knowledge of the ADA, or some combination of all of these factors.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <p>Keep in mind that ADA Title I (employment) issues are different than ADA Title III issues (public accommodations), and a particular mediator may be competent to mediate a case arising under one but not both of these titles.</p>  <h2>Making Mediations Accessible</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Guidelines make clear that mediation providers must make their services accessible to persons with disabilities. If the employer is running an internal mediation program, the employer must also ensure that the mediation is accessible.</p>  <p>Regarding accessibility, every aspect of media&shy;tion, from training sessions to mediation ses&shy;sions, should be accessible to all participants, including the parties, staff volunteers, and the mediators themselves. For these purposes, the broadest definition of disability should be applied so as to include even those individu&shy;als with temporary disabilities who might not otherwise be considered disabled under the ADA. This is in keeping with the generally accepted mediation principle that all par&shy;ties be able to participate fully in the process. Mediation programs should have a procedure in place by which individuals may request needed accommodations, and the mediator should be informed of any disability accom&shy;modation that is required. Simply stated, for a mediation to be successful, all parties must be able to attend. If one party is unable to attend because a needed accommodation is not pro&shy;vided, the mediation will not go forward.</p>  </div>  <h2>Capacity Issues</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">In order for a mediation to succeed, all parties must have the capacity to (a) understand the mediation process, (b) understand the options available to resolve the conflict, and (c) give informed consent to an acceptable resolution. Parties who do not possess these capacities are referred to as having &ldquo;diminished capacity&rdquo; under the law.</p>  <p>The vast majority of ADA employment me&shy;diations will not raise the issue of party ca&shy;pacity. Where party capacity is questioned, the Guidelines state that the mediator shall determine whether the party at issue under&shy;stands the nature of the mediation process, the role of the mediator, the parties&rsquo; relationship to the mediator, and the issues raised in the mediation. When determining whether the parties can understand options and enter into an agreement, the mediator is not obligated to rely solely on that party&rsquo;s medical condition or diagnosis.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">If a party appears to have diminished capacity or if capacity is unclear, the mediator should determine whether an accommodation would enable the party to participate effectively. If not, the mediator should determine if the person could mediate with support, such as with an attorney or with another supporting person. Finally, if a party lacks capacity to mediate even with support, the mediation can&shy;not proceed unless a surrogate represents that party&rsquo;s interests and makes decisions on his or her behalf. The Guidelines state that the issue of who can act as a surrogate is defined by state law, and might include agents with pow&shy;ers of attorney, guardians, or family members.</p>  <p>An adjudication of legal incapacity is not necessarily determinative of the capacity to mediate, depending on what issue is being mediated. For example, a person might have a guardian for financial matters, but not for personal or healthcare decisions. This person could participate in a mediation about his/her medical treatment, but would need to be rep&shy;resented by a guardian in a mediation involv&shy;ing financial issues. A mediation agreement signed by a person without legal capacity may require co-signing by a surrogate to ensure its enforceability.</p>  </div>  <h2>Who Will Attend the ADA Mediation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>As in any mediation, the disputing parties must attend. If one of the parties is a corpo&shy;ration or large organization, it may be repre&shy;sented by one or more individuals, including managers, human resource representatives, or counsel. In that circumstance, an individual with the authority to settle a case on behalf of the organization should be present.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Guidelines take the position that the par&shy;ties may each bring a representative of their choice to the mediation session. The repre&shy;sentative may be a disability rights advocate, expert, vocational rehabilitation counselor, job coach, family member, attorney, union repre&shy;sentative, or other person. The representative may advise and present on behalf of the party that they represent, but, unlike a surrogate, the representative does not make decisions for the party. Some parties may choose to bring a representative who provides emotional sup&shy;port rather than or in addition to one who acts as his or her advocate.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Persons with disabilities may be accompanied by a personal assistant (PA) who provides physical aid or other assistance. A qualified sign language or oral interpreter has the dual role of serving as an &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo; under the ADA<a href=\"#3\"><sup>3</sup></a> and of facilitating communications between the individual with a disability and the other mediation participants.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Finally, the parties may engage experts to edu&shy;cate the mediator and/or the parties about the disability and to assist in developing solutions. At times, the mediator may recommend that a neutral expert participate in the process, with the parties&rsquo; permission.</p>  <p>When the parties agree to a resolution, the mediator should ascertain whether the parties have considered the impact of their agreement on people who are not party to the mediation, such as other employees or labor union mem&shy;bers. The impact of the agreement on other parties may negatively affect the enforceabil&shy;ity, implementation, or durability of the agree&shy;ment.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"3\"><sup>3</sup> For more information regarding ADA accommodations, see the brochure from this series entitled &ldquo;Reasonable Accommodation under the ADA.&rdquo;</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>The Reasonable Accommodation Process During Mediation</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>In ADA Title I cases where reasonable accom&shy;modation is an issue, the mediation session provides the parties with an opportunity to further engage in an &ldquo;interactive process&rdquo; to identify and/or evaluate accommodation alternatives. Ideally, when the parties&rsquo; dispute involves accommodation, they will have com&shy;menced the process of determining a reason&shy;able accommodation prior to mediation of their dispute. The ADA Mediation Guidelines note that when the interactive process is tak&shy;ing place in the context of mediation, it must be clear that anything said or done &ndash; even as part of the interactive process &ndash; will remain confidential and inadmissible as evidence in any legal proceeding, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.</p>  </div>  <h2>Confidentiality</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Consistent with general confidentiality obli&shy;gations, the Guidelines state that mediators should maintain the confidentiality of disabil&shy;ity-related information when arranging access to and conducting the mediation. While the person with a disability may have disclosed his/her disability, there still may be informa&shy;tion that the person does not wish to reveal, such as the severity of his/her health problems. Where a mediator believes that disclosure of this information would be helpful to the medi&shy;ation, the mediator should invite disclosure by the person with a disability during a private caucus, but may not disclose this information without permission.</p>  </div>  <h2>Legal Information and Legal Advice</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">As is true in any mediation where legal rights are at stake, mediators should encourage the parties to become aware of their legal rights and responsibilities under the ADA prior to the mediation so that the parties can partici&shy;pate meaningfully and make informed deci&shy;sions. While educational materials, such as ADA booklets, may be helpful, they are not a substitute for legal advice and representation.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Guidelines note that before the media&shy;tion session and at the outset of each session, parties should be advised that they may obtain legal or other representation. Parties in an ADA mediation should be advised of the risks of not being represented by counsel and of not having a potential agreement reviewed by counsel.</p>  <p>The mediator may refer parties to resources for finding legal representation. Where the mediator believes that a party does not under&shy;stand the implications of a proposed agree&shy;ment, the mediator should encourage that party to consult appropriate sources of infor&shy;mation and advice.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This publication was created in July, 2000 by Sheila D.

Individuals with ADHD are commonly described as having chronic difficulties with inattention, and/or impulsivity and/or hyperactivity. They are believed to display these characteristics early, to a degree that is inappropriate for their age or developmental level. Characteristics of ADHD vary across a variety of situations that tax the capacity to pay attention, restrain movement, inhibit impulses, and regulate personnel behavior relative to rules, time, and the future.</p>  <p>At present, the primary characteristics of ADHD and the diagnostic criteria officially developed for clinical use are set forth in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994), which is used primarily in the United States. The criteria stipulate that individuals have their symptoms of ADHD for at least 6 months, that these symptoms are to a degree that is developmentally deviant, and that the symptoms have developed by 7 years of age.</p>  <p>There are three types of ADHD. The type of ADHD to be diagnosed depends on whether symptomology is congruent with the diagnostic criteria for ADHD: Predominantly Inattentive, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive, or Combined Type.</p>  </div>  <h2>What is the Impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act on People with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. Under the ADA, the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is defined as:</p>  <ol>  <li>a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of an individual,</li>  <li>a record of such an impairment or,</li>  <li>being regarded as having such an impairment.</li>  </ol>  <p>ADHD would be considered a mental impairment. &ldquo;Substantially limits&rdquo; means that the person is unable to perform, or is significantly limited in the ability to perform, an activity as compared with an average person in the general population. Major life activities include functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working. ADHD may substantially limit one or more of an individual&rsquo;s major life activities. Mitigating measures, such as medication, are considered in determining whether the impairment rises to the level of a disability.</p>  <p>For example, an individual with extreme inattentiveness caused by ADHD may be unable to grasp much of the information presented in weekly staff meetings or in regular monthly trainings. Even with medication, the individual may be significantly impaired in the ability to absorb and grasp information presented orally or in lecture format because of the inability to focus and pay attention. If the individual were significantly impaired, s/he would be considered an individual with a disability. As discussed below, there may be reasonable accommodations that would address these workplace concerns and allow the employee to be a successful and productive employee. The ADA requires an employer to provide an effective reasonable accommodation unless to do so would impose an undue hardship on the employer.</p>  <p>Furthermore, employers cannot discriminate against individuals with a record of ADHD, for example, by refusing to hire an individual with school records noting this diagnosis. The ADA also protects individuals who are perceived to have a substantially limiting impairment, even if they do not. For example, an employer may not refuse to promote an employee who is using medications to control his/her ADHD based on fears that the employee will be inattentive and impulsive when in fact that person&rsquo;s symptoms are successfully controlled.</p>  </div>  <h2>Causes of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Research has shown that neurological and genetic factors substantially contribute to symptoms of ADHD and the occurrence of the disorder. A variety of genetic and neurological causes (e.g., pregnancy and birth complications, acquired brain damage, toxins, infections, and genetic effects) can give rise to the disorder through some disturbance in a final pathway in the nervous system. It now appears that hereditary factors play a very large role in the occurrence of ADHD symptoms. It may be that what is transmitted genetically is a tendency towards the occurrence of disturbances in the nervous system.</p>  <p>The condition can also be caused or exacerbated by pregnancy complications, exposure to toxins, or neurological disease. Social factors alone are likely not a cause of this disorder, but such factors may exacerbate the condition, or contribute to its persistence.</p>  <p>Cases of ADHD can also arise without a genetic predisposition to the disorder, if the individual is exposed to significant disruption or neurological injury to this final common neurological pathway, but this would seem to account for only a small minority of people with ADHD.</p>  <p>ADHD is a developmental disorder, but can continue into adulthood. It may also be a condition that was present in childhood may be first diagnosed in adulthood, based a developmental history consistent with the diagnosis of ADHD.</p>  </div>  <h2>Potential Functional Limitations Caused by ADHD</h2>  <div class=\"section\"><b><i>Inattentive Type</i></b>  <p>Workers with ADHD, Predominately Inattentive Type may have difficulties with:</p>  <ul>  <li>Diminished persistence of effort or sustained responding to tasks that have little intrinsic appeal or minimal immediate consequences for completion</li>  <li>Sustaining attention</li>  <li>Becoming easily distracted</li>  <li>Listening to others</li>  <li>Following through on tasks or activities</li>  <li>Frequent shifting from one uncompleted activity to another</li>  </ul>  <p>Employers may observe that an employee with ADHD, Predominately Inattentive Type may exhibit some of the following behaviors:</p>  <ul>  <li>Doesn\'t seem to listen</li>  <li>Fails to finish assigned tasks</li>  <li>Daydreams</li>  <li>Often loses things</li>  <li>Can\'t concentrate</li>  <li>Is easily distracted</li>  <li>Can\'t work independently of supervision</li>  <li>Requires more redirection</li>  <li>Shifts from one uncompleted activity to another</li>  <li>Is confused or seems to be in a fog</li>  </ul>  <b><i>Impulsive Type</i></b>  <p>Workers with ADHD, Predominately Impulsive Type may have difficulties with:</p>  <ul>  <li>Forms of impulsivity often associated with under-control of behavior and the inability to delay a response or defer gratification</li>  <li>Behavioral disinhibition, or poor regulation and inhibition of behavior</li>  <li>Poor impulse control, such as difficulty awaiting turns</li>  <li>Difficulties in driving, such as speeding</li>  </ul>  <p>Employers may observe an employee with ADHD, Predominately Impulsive Type exhibiting some of the following behaviors:</p>  <ul>  <li>Blurting out answers</li>  <li>Interrupting or intruding on others</li>  <li>Making impulsive errors when driving</li>  <li>Impulsive comments to others</li>  <li>Difficulties in inhibiting the impulsive spending of money</li>  <li>Poor inhibition in their emotional reactions to others</li>  </ul>  <b><i>Hyperactivity</i></b>  <p>Workers with ADHD, Predominately Hyperactive Type may have difficulties with:</p>  <ul>  <li>Restlessness</li>  <li>Fidgeting</li>  <li>Generally unnecessary gross bodily movements</li>  <li>Being overly talkative and verbalizing more than others</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Workplace Accommodations for Individuals with ADHD</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>As noted, employers may not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability who can perform the essential functions of a job held or desired with or without a reasonable accommodation. If an employee has a disability and needs a reasonable accommodation, the employer must provide one unless it can prove that to do so presents an undue hardship. Reasonable accommodations are by definition individualized in order to meet the needs of the particular individual. Some accommodations include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Reduced distraction in work environments</li>  <li>Computer technology for written work to help with organization</li>  <li>Extended time to learn job tasks or to perform work</li>  <li>Instructions presented both in written and oral formats.</li>  <li>Allowing the employee to tape-record important information</li>  <li>Clearly defining job requirements, the dates when projects assignments are due; advance notice of any changes</li>  <li>Providing handouts and visual aids</li>  <li>Using more than one way to demonstrate or explain information</li>  <li>Breaking information into small steps when teaching many new tasks in one lesson (state objectives, review previous lesson, summarize periodically)</li>  <li>Allowing time for clarification of directions and essential information</li>  </ul>  <p>When in doubt about how best to assist an employee who needs an accommodation, sit down and have a talk about what is needed, and if necessary, obtain outside technical assistance. In addition, remember to observe confidentiality. For example, avoid pointing out the employee or the accommodation to others in the work group.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Eve Woodman Tominey  Matthew Tominey',NULL,142,'Cornell University',NULL,'July, 2000 ',NULL),(24,'Medical Screening','Employee Medical Exams and Disability-Related Inquiries under the ADA: Guidance for Employers Regarding Current Employees',3,'<h2>Overview</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p><strong>When does the ADA impact an employer&rsquo;s ability to require medical exams or make disability-related inquiries? </strong></p>  <p>The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &ldquo;ADA&rdquo;) applies to all employers with 15 or more employees. ADA rules apply to three distinct phases of the em&shy;ployment relationship: pre-offer, post-offer and during employment. The focus of this brochure is solely on what the employer can do during the employment phase, that is, after an employee is on board and working.</p>  <p><strong>Can an employer require an employee to have a medical exam or make disability-related inquiries?</strong></p>  <p>An employer may require a medical exam or make a disability-related inquiry of an employee as long as the inquiry or exam is job-related and consistent with business necessity. The meaning of the phrase &ldquo;job-related and consistent with business necessity&rdquo; will be discussed in a later section. Any medical information obtained from a disability-related inquiry or exam, as well as any medical infor&shy;mation voluntarily disclosed by an employee, must be treated as a confidential medical record.</p>  <p><strong>Do the ADA&rsquo;s provisions on medical exams and disability-related in&shy;quiries apply to all employees? </strong></p>  <p>Yes. The ADA&rsquo;s restrictions on inquiries and exams apply to all employees of covered employers, not just those with disabilities. While other ADA protections are limited to those individuals who can show they are qualified individuals with disabilities, the language of the ADA is clear that employers are not permit&shy;ted to ask questions or conduct medical examinations of any employee unless there is a legitimate purpose for doing so. Based on this language, the U.S. Equal Em&shy;ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has taken the position that any employee has the right to challenge a disability-related inquiry or medical exam that is not job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p><strong>What about temporary employees? </strong></p>  <p>As a general rule, an individual is an employ&shy;ee if an entity controls the means and manner of his/her work performance. Oftentimes, a temporary employee is both an employee of the employment agency and the employer to which s/he is assigned. As employers, the employment agency and the temporary em&shy;ployer could ask disability-related questions and require medical examinations only if they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  </div>  <h2>Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p><strong>What exactly is a disability-related &nbsp;inquiry? </strong></p>  <p>A disability-related inquiry is a question (or series of questions) that is likely to elicit infor&shy;mation about disability. This would include direct questions about disability, such as whether a person has or has ever had a dis&shy;ability, how they became disabled, or details about the nature or severity of their dis&shy;ability. In addition, questions about genetic information,1 prior workers&rsquo; compensation history, past or current prescription medica&shy;tions, or a broad inquiry about medical im&shy;pairments (e.g., &ldquo;tell me about every medical problem you have&rdquo;) would also be restricted because they are likely to yield information about disability. Restrictions on this type of inquiry apply both to questions asked of the person and questions asked of any other third party, such as a co-worker or doctor. Note that questions about illegal drug use or whether someone has been drinking are not disability-related inquiries.</p>  <p><strong>Does this mean I shouldn&rsquo;t even ask &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; </strong></p>  <p>Asking generally about an employee&rsquo;s well being is permitted. For example, it is perfectly fine to ask an employee who looks tired or ill whether s/he is feeling okay or to ask how an employee is doing following a divorce or loss of a loved one. Likewise, it is permissible to ask about nondisability-related impairments (e.g., &ldquo;how did you break your wrist?&rdquo;), or to inquire how a pregnant employee is feeling or when her baby is due. It is also okay to simply ask a person if s/he can do the job. Moreover, if the employee raises disability-related issues with the employer, it would be acceptable for the employer to discuss the matter with him/ her.</p>  <p><strong>When you say &ldquo;medical exam,&rdquo; does this mean a head-to-toes check-up by the doctor? </strong></p>  <p>A medical exam would include a complete physical; but the term, as used in the ADA, also includes a number of other more limited exams or procedures. In general, a medical exam is a procedure or test that seeks informa&shy;tion about an individual&rsquo;s physical or mental health. Various factors can make a test medi&shy;cal, including: whether a medical professional conducts or interprets the test, whether the test is designed to reveal an impairment or physical or mental health generally, whether the test measures the ability to perform a task versus physiological response to performing the task; or whether the test is invasive, uses medical equipment, or is conducted in a medical setting. Sometimes one of these factors is enough to make a procedure medical. Some&shy;times a combination of factors will be relevant.</p>  <p>In general, medical examinations would in&shy;clude the following:</p>  <ul>  <li>full or partial (e.g., back only) physical exam by a doctor or other medical profes&shy;sional</li>  <li>vision tests conducted and analyzed by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist</li>  <li>blood, urine, and breath tests to check for alcohol use</li>  <li>blood, urine, saliva, and hair analyses to detect disease or genetic markers</li>  <li>blood pressure and cholesterol screening</li>  <li>nerve conduction tests</li>  <li>range of motion tests that measure muscle strength and function</li>  <li>pulmonary function tests</li>  <li>psychological tests designed to measure a mental disorder or impairment</li>  <li>diagnostic procedures such as x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>What are some common employment tests that are not considered medical exams? </strong></p>  <p>There are a number of tests and procedures given by employers that are not considered medical, including:</p>  <ul>  <li>tests to determine the illegal use of drugs</li>  <li>physical agility tests, which measure an employee&rsquo;s ability to perform actual or simulated job tasks</li>  <li>physical fitness tests, which measure an employee&rsquo;s performance of physical tasks, such as running or lifting, as long as these tests do not include a medical component such as measuring heart rate or blood pressure</li>  <li>tests that measure an ability to read labels or distinguish objects as part of a dem&shy;onstration of the ability to do actual job functions</li>  <li>psychological tests that measure personal&shy;ity traits such as honesty, preferences, or habits</li>  <li>polygraph examinations</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>How should an employer treat an employee who applies for a new job within the company?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>The EEOC has taken the position that an em&shy;ployer should treat an employee who applies for a new job just like an outside applicant for the job. This means that the employer can&shy;not ask disability-related questions or require a medical exam before making a conditional offer of the new position. A current supervisor who has medical information about the em&shy;ployee should not disclose that information to the person conducting interviews for the new job or to the new supervisor.</p>  <p>Once a conditional offer is made, the employer may require a medical exam or ask disability&ndash; related questions as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same job category. If the job offer is subsequently withdrawn because of medical information, the employer must show that the withdrawal was job-relat&shy;ed and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p>An individual is not an applicant where s/he is noncompetitively entitled to another posi&shy;tion with the same employer (e.g., because of seniority or satisfactory performance in his/her present position). An individual who is tem&shy;porarily assigned to another position and then returns to his/her regular job is also not an ap&shy;plicant. Since these individuals are considered to be employees, the employer can only ask disability-related questions or require medical exams that are job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  </div>  <h2>Job-Related and Consistent with Business Necessity</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <div>  <p><strong>What does &ldquo;job-related and consistent with business necessity&rdquo; mean?&nbsp; </strong></p>  <p>The EEOC takes the position that a disability-related inquiry or medical exam of an employee may be &ldquo;job-related and consistent with business necessity&rdquo; when an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee&rsquo;s ability to do essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat to others or to him/herself due to a medical condition.&nbsp; This standard may be met if an employer knows about a particular employee&rsquo;s medical condition, has observed performance problems, and can reasonably attribute the problems to the medical condition.&nbsp; The standard may also be met when the employer has been given reliable information by a credible third party that the person has a medical condition or the employer has observed symptoms that indicate the person may have a medical condition that will impair the ability to do essential functions or will pose a direct threat.</p>  <p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp; A fork lift driver&rsquo;s job is to transport and stack pallets weighing several hundred to a thousand pounds in a storage warehouse with numerous workers on the floor.&nbsp; After an impeccable ten year work record, the fork lift driver crashes into a wall of stacked pallets, narrowly missing a co-worker.&nbsp; The employee explains that he felt dizzy and became disoriented, and that this has happened a few other times, although never at work.&nbsp; The employer believes that the employee may pose a direct threat and sends him for a medical examination to determine if he is fit to perform his job.&nbsp; The employer provides the doctor with a description of the job to help ensure an accurate determination.&nbsp; This examination would be considered job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Several months ago, a supervisor overheard two employees talking about another co-worker, who had told them about having a serious heart condition that necessitates the use of medication and frequent doctor&rsquo;s visits.&nbsp; The individual comes to work every day and successfully performs her duties as a computer programmer.&nbsp; In this case, the employer does not have a reasonable belief that the computer programmer&rsquo;s ability to perform her essential job functions are impaired or that sheposes a direct threat due to a medical condition.&nbsp; The employer may not make disability-related inquiries or require a medical examination.</p>  <p><strong>Are disability-related inquiries or medical exams following a request for reasonable accommodation job-related and consistent with business necessity? </strong></p>  <p>When an employee requests a workplace accommodation and the disability or need for accommodation is not obvious, it is job-related and consistent with business necessity for the employer to ask an employee for reasonable documentation about his/her disability and its functional limitations that require accommodation.</p>  <p>An employer may require an employee to provide documentation that is sufficient to substantiate that s/hehas an ADA disability and needs the accommodation requested.&nbsp; Documentation is sufficient if it (1) describes the nature, severity, and duration of the employee&rsquo;s impairment, the activity or activities that the impairment limits, and the extent to which the impairment limits the employee&rsquo;s ability to perform the activity or activities; and (2) substantiates why the requested accommodation is needed to enable the employee to perform essential job functions.</p>  <p>Note that an employer cannot ask for unrelated documentation&mdash;and thus, the request must be tailored to reveal only the information necessary to answer the employer&rsquo;s inquiry.&nbsp; The practical consequence of this is that an employer generally cannot ask for complete medical records because they would contain unrelated information.</p>  <p>Example: &nbsp;A secretary with no known disability asks for an ergonomic chair because of back pain.&nbsp; The employer may ask the employee to provide documentation from her treating physician that: (1) describes the nature, severity, and duration of the impairment, the activity or activities that the impairment limits, and the extent to which the impairment limits her ability to perform the activity or activities; and (2) substantiates why the ergonomic chair is needed.&nbsp; If the employee fails to provide the documentation, the employer would not be required to provide the chair.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Practical Dos and Donts Regarding Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <div>  <p><strong>May an employer require an employee to go to a health care professional of the employer&rsquo;s (rather than the employee&rsquo;s) choice when the employee requests a reasonable accommodation?</strong></p>  <p>The EEOC has taken the position that the ADA does not prevent an employer from requiring an employee to go to an appropriate health care professional of the employer&rsquo;s choice if the employee provides insufficient documentation from his/her treating physician (or other medical professional) to substantiate an ADA disability and the need for accommodation.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the employer must first give the employee the chance to provide that missing information.&nbsp;</p>  <p>As long as the employer&rsquo;s request for additional information or another medical exam is based on a good faith belief that the information it has gotten so far is insufficient, such request would not be considered a form of retaliation and the employer would not be liable for violating the ADA.&nbsp; According to the EEOC, the employer may consider documentation to be insufficient if it does not specify that a disability exists or explain the need for accommodation.&nbsp; Other circumstances in which documentation may be considered insufficient include those in which the health professional does not have the necessary expertise to opine about the employee&rsquo;s condition or those in which factors relating to the documentation suggest that it is fraudulent.</p>  <p>The EEOC&rsquo;s recommendation that the employer should also consider getting the employee&rsquo;s permission to consult directly with the employee&rsquo;s doctor before requiring the employee to go to the employer&rsquo;s doctor is a good, cost effective approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a practical matter, the employer may want to have its doctor consult directly with the employee&rsquo;s physician.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Any medical examination conducted by the employer&rsquo;s health care professional must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.&nbsp; Specifically, it must be limited to determining the existence of an ADA disability and the functional limitations that require a reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>May an employer require that an employee, who it reasonably believes will pose a direct threat, be examined by an appropriate health care professional of the employer&rsquo;s choice?</p>  <p>Yes.&nbsp; The EEOC has stated that an employer may have an employee, who it believes poses a direct threat, examined by a healthcare professional of its choosing who has expertise in the employee&rsquo;s specific condition and can provide medical information that allows the employer to determine the effects of the condition on the employee&rsquo;s ability to do his job.&nbsp; The exam would be limited to determining whether the employee can perform his job without posing a direct threat, with or without reasonable accommodation.&nbsp; In most circumstances, the employer could not request complete medical records because they would contain unrelated information.</p>  <p>The employer should be very cautious about relying solely on its medical provider&rsquo;s conclusion if it conflicts with the opinion of the employee&rsquo;s treating physician.&nbsp; In evaluating both opinions, the employer may find it helpful to consider: (1) the medical expertise of each health care professional; (2) what kind of information was provided to each medical professional regarding the job&rsquo;s essential functions and the work environment; (3) whether an opinion is based upon speculation or current, objectively verifiable information about the risks associated with a particular condition; and (4) whether the medical opinion is contradicted by information known or observed by the employer (e.g., information about the employee&rsquo;s actual experience in the current or previous job(s)).&nbsp; Remember that it is ultimately the employer who is responsible for the final decision, not the doctor.</p>  <strong>Who pays when the employee is sent to the employer&rsquo;s health care professional?</strong>  <p>The EEOC has taken the position that if an employer requires an employee to go to a health care provider of the employer&rsquo;s choice, the employer must pay all costs associated with the visit(s).</p>  <p><strong>What about requiring all employees to report their prescription medications?</strong></p>  <p>This type of broad inquiry would not generally be permissible.&nbsp; The EEOC has stated that in a few narrow exceptions, such as with armed police officers or airline pilots, an inquiry regarding which of their medications could interfere with their ability to perform the essential functions of their jobs would be job-related and consistent with business necessity.&nbsp; To the contrary, however, employers would not likely be able to show that fire department employees who perform only administrative duties pose a direct threat, and, in such case, could not require them to report any medications.</p>  </div>  <div>  <p>An argument could also be made that in other jobs where safety is an issue, for example, certain construction, manufacturing, and driving jobs, it may be job-related and consistent with business necessity to require employees to report medications that would impair their performance.&nbsp; Note, however, that this appears to be a broader approach than the EEOC&rsquo;s stated position.</p>  <p><strong>What if the employee refuses to answer a disability-related question or submit to a medical exam?</strong></p>  <p>The action the employer may take depends upon its reason for making the inquiry or requiring the exam.&nbsp; If the requested medical exam relates to performance problems on the job, any discipline that the employer decides to impose should focus on the employee&rsquo;s performance problems.&nbsp; Thus, the employer may discipline the employee for past and future performance problems in accordance with a uniformly applied policy.</p>  <p>If the employee refuses to answer a disability-related question or submit to a medical exam after requesting a reasonable accommodation, and the disability and need for an accommodation is not obvious, the employer could refuse to provide the accommodation.&nbsp; If the requested accommodation was leave, the employer could deny the leave and refuse to excuse absences.</p>  </div>  <div>  <p>Many courts would also construe the employee&rsquo;s failure to cooperate as a failure to engage in the ADA&rsquo;s interactive process to determine an effective reasonable accommodation, and would likely reject any later ADA claim made on this basis.</p>  <p><strong>How can employers make sure that employees can safely perform physical agility or fitness tests?</strong></p>  <p>Employers that require physical agility or physical fitness tests may ask an employee to have a doctor certify that s/he can safely perform the test.&nbsp; The employer would be entitled to a note which simply states that the person can safely perform the test or, alternatively, an explanation of why the person cannot perform the test.&nbsp; An employer could not ask for complete medical records or any other medical information going beyond the individual&rsquo;s ability to safely perform the test.</p>  </div>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Leave Issues</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\">The following three questions assume that the employee has used sick, annual, or some other type of leave due to a medical condition, but has not officially taken leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1994 (FMLA). The rules promulgated under the FMLA are dis&shy;cussed later in this section.<a href=\"\"http://hrtips.org/admin/2\"\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>What about requiring doctor&rsquo;s notes regarding the use of sick leave? </strong></p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\">An employer may ask an employee to justify his/her use of sick leave by providing a doc&shy;tor&rsquo;s note or other explanation, as long as it has a policy or practice of requiring all em&shy;ployees, with and without disabilities, to do so under similar circumstances.</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>Can the employer request periodic up&shy;dates when an employee is on extend&shy;ed leave? </strong></p>  <p>Yes. If the employee&rsquo;s leave request did not specify an exact or reasonably specific return date, or if additional leave is being requested, the employer may require the employee to provide periodic updates on his condition and possible date of return. Note, however that when the employer has granted a fixed amount of leave and no additional leave has been requested, the EEOC has taken the posi&shy;tion that it would not be permissible to ask for periodic updates. An employer may always call an employee on extended leave to express concern for their health or check on their prog&shy;ress.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>Are return-to-work releases or exams allowed? </strong></p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\">When an employee has been on leave, the employer may request a &ldquo;return-to-work&rdquo; release from the employee&rsquo;s treating physician or may require a &ldquo;return-to-work&rdquo; exam if the employer has a reasonable belief that an em&shy;ployee&rsquo;s present ability to perform essential job functions is impaired by a medical condition or that s/he poses a direct threat due to a medi&shy;cal condition. Usually, only inquiries or medi&shy;cal exams related to the condition for which the person took leave would be warranted.</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>An attorney breaks his leg skiing and is on leave for four weeks. He returns to work on crutches. The employer does not have a reasonable belief that the attorney will be unable to perform the essential functions of his job or pose a direct threat because of the injury. The employer could not make disabili&shy;ty-related inquires or require a medical exam, but could ask the attorney how he is doing or express concern for his condition.</p>  <p><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>As the result of problems with his medication, an employee with a known psy&shy;chiatric disability threatens several colleagues and is disciplined. Shortly afterwards, he is hospitalized for six weeks for treatment related to his condition. Two days after his release, he returns to work with a note stating that &ldquo;he is cleared to return to work.&rdquo; Because the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition, the employer may ask the employee for additional documentation regarding his medication or treatment or request that he submit to a medi&shy;cal examination.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>What about requests for leave under the FMLA? </strong></p>  <p>The FMLA, enforced by the Department of Labor, sets forth its own requirements for employers and employees in regard to leave. The EEOC has stated that when an employee requests leave under the FMLA for a serious health condition, employers will not violate the ADA by asking for the information in the FMLA certification form. The FMLA only requests information relating to the particu&shy;lar serious health condition, as defined in the FMLA, for which the employee is seeking leave. An employer is entitled to know why an employee is requesting time off from work under the FMLA. If inquiries are precisely tailored in this manner, they would be job-related and consistent with business necessity under the ADA.</p>  <hr />  <div id=\"\"2\"\"><sup>2</sup> Additional information may be found in the brochure entitled <i>Leave Rights under the FMLA and the ADA: the Intersection of Two Laws Impacting Employee Leave</i>, available at http://www.hrtips.org</div>  </div>  <h2>Periodic Monitoring</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>May employers require periodic medical examinations of employees in posi&shy;tions affecting public safety? </strong></p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\">Yes. In limited circumstances, periodic medi&shy;cal examinations and other monitoring of employees in public safety positions, (e.g., firefighters and police officers) that are narrowly tailored to address specific job-related concerns may be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>A fire department could require its firefighters (but not the firehouse adminis&shy;trative staff) to have a comprehensive visual exam every two years and have an annual electrocardiogram because it is concerned that certain visual disorders and heart problems will affect their ability to do their job without posing a direct threat.</p>  <p>If an employer decides to terminate or take other adverse action against an employee with a disability based upon the results of a medical exam, it must demonstrate that the employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his/her job, or in fact poses a direct threat that cannot be reduced or elimi&shy;nated by reasonable accommodation. The employer could conduct additional medical testing after discovering the condition in or&shy;der to make this determination.</p>  <p><strong>May an employer require an employee, who has been off from work in an al&shy;cohol rehabilitation program, to sub&shy;mit to periodic alcohol testing when she returns to work? </strong></p>  <p>Yes, but only if the employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence that the employee will pose a direct threat in the ab&shy;sence of periodic testing. This would require an individualized assessment and could not be based on general assumptions. The em&shy;ployer would need to consider the safety risks associated with the position, the consequences of the employee&rsquo;s inability or impaired ability to perform job functions, and how recently the event(s) occurred that cause the employer to believe that the employee would pose a di&shy;rect threat. At some point, when the employ&shy;ee has repeatedly tested negative for alcohol, continued testing may not be job-related and consistent with business necessity because the employer no longer has a reasonable belief that the employee will pose a direct threat.</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\"><strong><em>Example: </em></strong>A bus driver informs his supervisor that he has a history of alcoholism and after many years of sobriety has started drinking a couple of glasses of wine at night to deal with family stress. He requests and is granted leave to enter a rehabilitation program. Af&shy;ter four months, he is cleared to return to work. Given the safety risks associated with his position, his short period of employment, and his recent completion of rehabilitation, the employer can show that it would be job-relat&shy;ed and consistent with business necessity to subject the driver to frequent periodic alcohol tests following his return to work.</p>  <p>Employers may also conduct periodic alcohol testing based on a &ldquo;last chance&rdquo; agreement related to disciplinary actions involving em&shy;ployee use of alcohol. This type of agree&shy;ment typically provides that, as a condition of continued employment, employees must enter into a rehabilitation program and submit to periodic alcohol testing.</p>  </div>  <h2>Other Acceptable Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>What may an EAP counselor ask? </strong></p>  <p>An Employee Assistance Program (EAP) counselor may ask an employee seeking help for personal problems about their medical conditions as long as s/he does not act on be&shy;half of the employer, is obligated to shield the information from decisionmakers, and has no power to affect employment decisions. Many employers contract with outside EAP con&shy;tractors so that employees are not concerned about confidentiality.</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa4\"\"><strong>May an employer make disability-relat&shy;ed inquiries that are required by anoth&shy;er federal law? </strong></p>  <p>Yes. An employer may make disability-related inquiries or require medical exams that are mandated or necessitated by another federal law or regulation. For example, federal safety regulations require interstate truck drivers to undergo medical examinations at least once every two years. Pilots and flight attendants must also meet federal medical requirements.</p>  <p>Other federal laws requiring medical exams include the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the Federal Mine Health and Safety Act and other federal statutes requiring the periodic monitoring of employees exposed to toxic or hazardous substances.</p>  <p><strong>May an employer make disability-re&shy;lated inquiries or conduct medical ex&shy;aminations that are part of a voluntary wellness program? </strong></p>  <p>Yes. The ADA allows employers to conduct voluntary medical examinations and activities, including voluntary medical histories that are part of an employee health program, without having to show that they are job-related and consistent with business necessity, as long as these medical records are kept confidential and separate from personnel records. These programs often include blood pressure screen&shy;ing, cholesterol testing, glaucoma testing, and cancer detection screening. A voluntary wellness program is voluntary as long as an employer neither requires participation nor penalizes employees who do not participate.</p>  <p><strong>What about exams related to workers&rsquo; compensation injuries? </strong></p>  <p>State workers&rsquo; compensation statutes typically allow employers to investigate and contest employees&rsquo; claims for work-related injuries. The EEOC has stated that the ADA does not prohibit an employer or its agent (for example, workers&rsquo; compensation carriers) from asking disability-related questions or requiring medi&shy;cal exams that are necessary to determine the extent of its workers&rsquo; compensation liability. However, such inquiries or exams must be limited in scope to the occupational injury and its impact on the individual, and may not be required more often than is necessary to deter&shy;mine the person&rsquo;s initial or continued eligibil&shy;ity for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits.</p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\"><strong>May an employer ask employees to voluntarily self-identify as persons with disabilities for affirmative action purposes? </strong></p>  <p class=\"\"Pa2\"\">Yes. An employer may ask employees to voluntarily self-identify as individuals with disabilities when the employer is:</p>  <ul>  <li>undertaking affirmative action because of a federal, state or local law (including a veteran&rsquo;s preference law) that requires affirmative action for individuals with dis&shy;abilities; or</li>  <li>voluntarily using the information to ben&shy;efit individuals with disabilities.</li>  </ul>  <p>The EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Disabil&shy;ity-Related Inquiries and Medical Examina&shy;tions sets forth some other detailed require&shy;ments for employers who invite employees to self-identify in either of these situations.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Sheila D.

In fact, the Census Bureau estimates that the total medical, income replacement, and productivity-related costs of disability will top $340 billion in the year 2000<sup>1</sup>, a fact many companies have begun to take very seriously. In times of tight labor markets, no employer can afford to lose even one valued employee due to poorly managed health or disability.</p>  <p>The field of disability management (DM), which was born of employer efforts to control disability costs beginning in the mid-1980&iexcl;&brvbar;s, has undergone unprecedented change and growth since then due at least in part to the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990. &iexcl;&sect;Disability management is a workplace prevention and remediation strategy that seeks to prevent disability from occurring or, lacking that, to intervene early following the onset of a disability, using coordinated, cost-conscious, quality case management and rehabilitation services that reflect an organizational commitment to continued employment of those experiencing functional work limitations<sup>2</sup>. This definition, which first appeared in a 1992 text on disability management, is still applicable today although the scope of services and interventions that can help to manage and minimize the impact of disabling injuries and illness on the individual and on the organization has expanded exponentially.</p>  <p>The concept of DM is a simple one &iexcl;V connect all the individual care, benefit, and case management components so they complement each other. In its simplest form, integrated disability management coordinates occupational and non-occupational disability benefits and absence and paid leave programs with a focus on early return to work. Increasingly, DM programs also coordinate health care, employee assistance (EAP) and behavioral health care, health promotion, disease management, and medical case management services all aimed at improving overall workforce health, easing the administrative burden, and providing a seamless set of benefits for workers with disabling injuries and illnesses.</p>  <p>Integration of DM program functions becomes complex, however, given the scope of programs, policies, and practices to be integrated: data management from multiple internal and external sources; education of health care providers; management of multiple vendors for case management, insurance (or self-insured administration), health care, and rehabilitation services; and, last but not least, training front-line supervisors in the intricacies of managing return to work. Every organization&iexcl;&brvbar;s situation is different and no single integration model will work well for every company. But all organizations must be mindful of the reasonable accommodation requirements of the ADA in designing and implementing return-to-work policies and programs for their employees with disabilities.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup><br /> Friend, D.

New York: AMACOM, p.2.</div>  </div>  <h2>How have DM programs grown and developed?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Disability management programs have been utilized increasingly over the past decade by businesses seeking to control the cost of workplace disability. The Washington Business Group on Health, in collaboration with human resources consulting firm, Watson Wyatt Worldwide, has surveyed large employers since 1996 regarding their DM program activities and concerns. The most recent survey results indicate that 43% of large corporations have implemented some form of integrated DM program, up from 23% in 1996<sup>3</sup>. As the number of programs has increased, so too have corporate expectations of DM program efforts. In 1996, most companies responding to the &iexcl;&sect;Staying @ Work&iexcl;&uml; survey indicated that increased frequency of return-to-work outcomes and reduced benefit costs were the primary measures of program success. However, by 1999, businesses reported that improved customer satisfaction, reduced absenteeism, and increased productivity were also being tracked to determine if DM program efforts had a positive impact on overall business success.</p>  <p>This bottom line orientation to measuring DM program effectiveness encompassed ADA compliance once the Title I provisions were implemented in 1992 as many corporations recognized the importance of reasonable accommodation as the key to early return to work as well as reduced liability for discrimination. One large financial institution reorganized its human resources departments in 1993 so that ADA compliance efforts, previously a part of its equal employment opportunity program, became the responsibility of the disability management department, which also coordinated occupational and non-occupational return-to-work efforts.<sup>4</sup> Many large companies have recognized that the reasonable accommodation process mandated by the ADA requires essentially the same analysis of work limitations and modified work options as typical transitional return-to-work programs.<sup>5</sup> Thus, its DM program is ideally positioned to address both temporary and permanent work return issues.</p>  <p>In addition to addressing return to work following injuries or illnesses, DM programs have also begun to collaborate with corporate health promotion and disease management efforts in order to reduce the incidence of preventable health conditions and intervene early with chronic illnesses and to teach self management skills and reduce acute episodes requiring additional time off work. As the workforce ages, the incidence of disability among the employed population is expected to rise thereby challenging employers to maintain maximum workplace flexibility and to accommodate the needs of older workers by providing, for example, assistive technology, flexible schedules, and telecommuting options.</p>  <p>Employee assistance programs (EAP) have also begun to partner with DM programs to identify employees with mental health problems who can benefit from reasonable accommodation of work limitations associated with these types of disorders. Mental health disorders are typically considered by employers to be the most difficult types of disabilities to accommodate. Recent research indicates that structuring benefit plans to provide more generous behavioral health coverage often saves money by reducing the overall cost associated with lost work days.<sup>6</sup> Thus, integrated DM approaches to managing behavioral health problems in the workplace rely on reasonable accommodation efforts to return employees with mental health related disabilities to work in order to demonstrate a return on investment for the cost of more expansive, and more expensive, mental health treatment options. The cost of such treatment is usually more than offset by the gains in workplace productivity by returning employees with psychiatric disabilities to work.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup><br /> Staying @ Work: Increasing Shareholder Value through Integrated Disability Management.

When an employee is injured or becomes ill, he/she is directed to the DM program to determine which of the often multiple disability benefit option offerings (sick leave, salary continuance, workers&iexcl;&brvbar; compensation, short term or long term disability, retirement disability, etc.) may be appropriate. A single point of contact (such as &iexcl;&sect;800&iexcl;&uml; phone lines) often serves to assure that employees working in 24-hour operations or in widely dispersed locations around the country or around the world can quickly access benefits to which they are entitled once they become disabled. On-line enrollment and application processes have also evolved over the past several years to serve the needs of an increasingly computer-dependent and networked workforce. Such operations also serve as data collection points for absence and disability information used by companies to determine if DM efforts have the desired impact, i.e., reduce lost time and improve return-to-work outcomes. <br /><br /> Compliance with ADA Titles I and III can be enhanced through centralized benefit and absence management efforts. Employees are assured immediate and seamless access to benefits through personal contact, phone lines, or on-line connections. Plan descriptions and information are also readily available if questions concerning coverage arise. Fast and efficient leave and benefits processing means that return to work and accommodation efforts begin as soon as medically feasible. <br /><br /></li>  <li>Identification of essential job functions: The ADA states that an individual with a disability must be qualified to perform the &iexcl;&sect;essential job functions&iexcl;&uml; of the position which he/she holds or seeks in order to seek reasonable accommodation. The essential job functions of a position are the foundation upon which DM staff evaluate the qualifications of employees with disabilities and determine what, if any, reasonable accommodation options exist. An essential job function is a set of tasks that comprises the most important activities of a job &iexcl;V they are not job skills, individual job tasks, or job descriptions. Thus, in making return-to-work recommendations, a DM staff person must determine what the essential job functions are that must be accomplished in order for modified work to be successful and productive. <br /><br /></li>  <li>Clarification of work limitations: DM programs serve a critical function linking physicians, employees with disabilities, and the company in developing return-to-work plans. Typically, companies employ nurse/case managers (either internally or externally contracted) to communicate with treating physicians regarding recuperation and return to work for employees with disabilities. Their job is to assure that employees receive appropriate, timely treatment and that any resulting work limitations are stated unambiguously, clearly, and in such a manner as to facilitate the modified work/return-to-work process. Even before issues of permanent accommodation arise, transitional job assignments must take into consideration the nature and extent of limitations experienced by employees recovering from injuries or illnesses. Should limitations persist, employer DM efforts to verify and understand restrictions as they change over time places the company in a stronger position to develop permanent reasonable accommodations under the ADA when and if that becomes necessary. <br /><br /></li>  <li>Development of modified job, return-to-work options: The heart of DM is facilitating an employee&iexcl;&brvbar;s return to work as soon as medically appropriate. Not only does the employer regain the services of a trained employee, but being back in the work environment often further speeds recovery for employees with disabilities. Non-discrimination under the ADA is also achieved by providing reasonable accommodation for disability-related limitations that restrict employees&iexcl;&brvbar; ability to work. Most companies develop human resource policies and supervisory training materials to reinforce and support the return-to-work process with guidance from the DM program staff. <br /><br /> Return-to-work/accommodation options include transitional work (temporary changes in job duties or techniques during periods of recuperation); modified work (changes in work tasks, schedules, methods, or equipment); or alternate work (reassignment to a different job if accommodations cannot be made in the original position). Typically, DM staff follow the reasonable accommodation process (even if restrictions are expected to be temporary) in order to make appropriate return-to-work decisions. First, DM staff analyze the job and determine the essential job functions. Then, they identify and clarify any disability-related restrictions, and generate a set of return-to-work options that appear to meet the work restriction needs of the employee with a disability. Finally, DM staff select the option that best balances the employee&iexcl;&brvbar;s needs and the company&iexcl;&brvbar;s expectations for productive work assignment and their business needs. <br /><br /></li>  <li>Interactive dialogue: Engaging employees with disabilities in meaningful discussion of their work options is a basic tenet of the ADA. Courts have found in favor of ADA plaintiffs/employees whose employers have attempted to impose accommodation options without having first had an interactive dialogue with them to assure their understanding and gain their agreement with accommodation plans. But beyond simply avoiding lawsuits, engaging employees in the return-to-work process makes good sense. Supervisors must feel comfortable that they understand the nature of an employee&iexcl;&brvbar;s work limitations. Both ultimately must have a stake in the success of any modified return-to-work plans and the earlier a dialogue between them can begin after an employee&iexcl;&brvbar;s disability becomes evident, the better. DM program staff provide the link between employees, physicians, and line supervisors to facilitate this discussion and resolve any issues that arise in the course of developing a return-to-work plan.</li>  </ol>  <p>The following is a table representing how disability management functions contribute to ADA compliance:</p>  <table border=\"1\">  <tbody>  <tr><th>DM Program Functions</th><th>ADA Compliance Impact</th></tr>  <tr>  <td>Transitional/modified return to work</td>  <td>Aids reasonable accommodation<br /> essential job function analysis<br /> identification of job accommodation options<br /> identification of job aids, assistive devices</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Benefits coordination, occupational and non-occupational disability</td>  <td>Ensures equal access to benefits (Title III)</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Benefits application processing</td>  <td>Ensures equal and timely access to benefits</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Case management</td>  <td>Aids reasonable accommodation<br /> clarification of work limitations<br /> identification of job accommodation options</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Internal disability management process</td>  <td>Aids reasonable accommodation<br /> provides mechanism for evaluating/funding accommodations<br /> promotes interactive dialog</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Independent medical exams</td>  <td>Aids reasonable accommodation<br /> clarification of work limitations</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Education of supervisors, physicians regarding return-to-work process</td>  <td>Promotes interactive dialog</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Safety and illness prevention</td>  <td>Aids reasonable accommodation<br /> identification of job aids, assistive devices (particularly ergonomic)</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>  </div>  <h2>How can DM programs assure ADA compliance?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>A Cornell University survey (conducted with the Washington Business Group on Health, the Society for Human Resources Management, and the Federal government) provides a comprehensive assessment of both private and public sector organizational responses to the provisions of the ADA. Forty-five per cent of private sector employers (and 42% of government agencies) indicated that they have established formal DM/return-to-work programs and another 34% of private sector employers (and 24% of government agencies) stated that they had \"informal\" programs. An additional set of questions details the intersection between DM programs, among those organizations reporting that they had them, and ADA compliance by asking employers what contribution their DM programs had made to improving ADA compliance. The results:</p>  <ul>  <li>89% of private sector companies (and 85% of federal sector agencies) said that DM programs reinforced the importance of confidentiality. Given rising concerns about Internet privacy and medical confidentiality, it is an encouraging sign that DM programs help to create an atmosphere that protects employee privacy while at the same time working to accommodate employees with disabilities.</li>  <li>88% of private sector organizations (and 73% of federal government agencies) credit DM programs with raising acceptance of employees with disabilities in the workplace. The full inclusion of people with disabilities is a central theme of the ADA, and DM programs have advanced that aim in the workplace by supporting practices that normalize return to work and embed the reasonable accommodation process in organizational life.</li>  <li>87% of private sector companies (and 75% of federal sector agencies) found that DM programs raised supervisor awareness of the accommodation process. Employers report they have completed staff training on a wide variety of disability and return-to-work related topics most of which involve or are influenced by DM program staff.</li>  <li>79% of public sector employers (and 71% of public sector organizations) create an organizational structure for funding accommodations through their DM programs. Many companies have developed central accommodation funds that pay for worksite modifications above a predetermined ceiling (usually several hundred dollars). This reduces the impact of any expensive accommodations on small department budgets while providing a convenient means to track the provision of accommodation services company-wide.</li>  </ul>  <p>In order to assure consistent application of reasonable accommodation principles, DM programs have developed organization-wide communications concerning the importance of return to work. Such policies create a \"return-to-work culture\" that encourages cooperation and flexibility in developing return-to-work options for employees with disabilities and reduces \"entitlement mentality,\" a tendency for employees to feel that disability leave is an entitlement (like paid vacation leave). Before DM programs became widespread, employers were often unwitting \"co-malingerers,\" enabling and even encouraging employees with even minor ailments to stay off work until they were \"100% recovered.\" Now, such behavior is viewed as not only counterproductive (since it runs counter to the early return to work/productivity perspective) but is proscribed by the ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>What does the future hold?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Can businesses comply with the ADA and contain disability costs at the same time? In fact, cost containment and compliance go hand-in-hand. \"Doing the right thing\" also facilitates return to work, which, in turn, is correlated with reduced workplace disability costs. Although recent Supreme Court cases have begun to define the limits of ADA coverage, there are concerns that unreasonable expansion of ADA provisions may undermine the generally positive perception that businesses hold of the law. This need not be the case, however, because businesses have every incentive to continue to expand on DM program successes of the past decade.</p>  <p>As more companies realize the benefits of active return-to-work/DM programs, acceptance of people with disabilities in the workplace will increase. As employers experiment with more expansive employee health benefit programs designed to improve chronic illness management, former Social Security Disability Insurance recipients may find the workplace a more secure and inviting alternative under the Ticket to Work/Work Incentives Improvement Act. DM efforts to improve return-to-work outcomes will ultimately result in greater workplace flexibility and reduced benefit costs, generally, which, in turn, will pave the way for improved employment prospects for people with disabilities. And in the high-need, high tech employment arena, assistive technology will continue to expand employment opportunities for even those with the most severe disabilities.</p>  <p>Thus, DM programs have not only saved benefit dollars and helped employees with disabilities become more productive, they have changed American business culture. DM programs have helped to lay the foundation within corporate America for the full inclusion of people with disabilities.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Bruce G.

An estimated 43 million Americans are affected by the disease. Many face work-related physical limitations. The total cost of arthritis, including medical care and lost productivity, is nearly $65 billion per year.</p>  </div>  <h2>A Brief Overview of Arthritis</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>It is important to note that there are more than 100 different types of arthritis, each producing different symptoms and levels of impairment. Some of the most common forms of arthritis include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, and lupus.</p>  <p>Osteoarthritis, often called degenerative arthritis, involves the breakdown of bones and cartilage, causing pain and stiffness. Osteoarthritis commonly affects the movement and function of fingers, knees, feet, hips, and back.</p>  <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an abnormality in the immune system causing inflammation of the lining in the joints and/or internal organs. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects the same joints on both sides of the body and can affect the hands, wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw, and elbows. The disease may also cause inflammation of internal organs, leading to significant organ damage. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis are likely to experience times when they have few symptoms and other times when they have very severe symptoms causing significant limitations.</p>  <p>Fibromyalgia has become a more common diagnosis during the past several years. It is a condition that affects muscles and their attachments to bone and is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, stiffness, sleep disturbance, and psychological distress.</p>  <p>Lupus is a rheumatic disease affecting skin and body tissue. Additionally, some people experience involvement of organs such as kidneys, lungs, or heart. Lupus is generally diagnosed between age 18 and 45. Symptoms include skin rashes, abnormal sun sensitivity, and joint pain, inflammation, and stiffness. Lupus is treatable, but can be a very serious impairment. Individuals with lupus will experience flares and remissions. A flare is a period of worsening symptoms. A remission is a period with few or no symptoms of the disease.</p>  <p>Regardless of the specific diagnosis, individuals with arthritis need appropriate rest and exercise. It is important that they learn to pace their activities and maintain appropriate self-care skills to minimize pain and functional loss. With reasonable accommodations from employers, many people with arthritis continue to be productive employees.</p>  </div>  <h2>Who is considered an individual with a disability?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Many people with arthritis would meet the definition of an &ldquo;individual with a disability&rdquo; under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Under the ADA, an individual with a disability is a person who: has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.</p>  <p>An impairment is substantially limiting if it prevents or significantly restricts the performance of a major life activity. The nature, severity, duration, and long-term impact of the condition are all factors that go into determining whether an impairment rises to the level of an ADA disability. Mitigating measures, such as medication, must also be considered. Thus, if an individual&rsquo;s arthritis is completely or substantially controlled with medication all the time, s/he would not be considered to have an ADA disability because the condition does not substantially limit a major life activity.</p>  <p>The ADA does not cover impairments that are relatively minimal in nature and severity or that are considered short-term (e.g., mild arthritis in a finger causing only occasional discomfort). Many forms of arthritis (e.g., rheumatoid, lupus) can be controlled with proper treatment. However, even when properly treated, an individual with arthritis may have periods of severe pain and functional limitation. In this situation, the ADA would apply even when the arthritis is in remission. Chronic conditions that are substantially limiting when active or have a high likelihood of recurrence in substantially limiting forms are covered under the ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are reasonable accommodations?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The ADA requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified disabled individuals in three areas of employment: 1) the job application process, 2) job functions, and 3) benefits and privileges of employment. A reasonable accommodation is any modification to a job, employment practice or process, or a work environment that makes it possible for an individual with a disability to successfully fulfill the duties of a job. Employers are not required to provide items primarily for personal use, such as purchasing a wheelchair.</p>  <p>Reasonable accommodations are not nearly as costly as many employers fear. A study conducted by the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) in 1990 showed that one third of all accommodations were accomplished with no cost to the employer and more than half cost $1,000.00 or less; eighty percent of the accommodations that JAN suggests cost less than $500.00. Additionally, most employers surveyed indicated that their company had benefited overall financially as a result of making job accommodations.</p>  </div>  <h2>How do I know the requested accommodation is necessary and is the most appropriate accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The individual with a disability will likely have a great deal of experience modifying tasks. It is logical to use his/her expertise. It is also important to consider the individual&rsquo;s preferences as well as the employer&rsquo;s needs. Working together to outline various options for accommodating the individual will likely be the most beneficial approach. Occupational therapists can also help by completing evaluations of the workstation and the employee&rsquo;s functioning. The therapist can offer suggestions for modifying the workstation or the process the employee uses to complete a task. S/he will work with the employer and employee to find accommodations that are both effective and reasonable. Assistance is also available through organizations such as the regional ADA Disability and Business Technical Assistance Center, the Job Accommodation Network, and the local Vocational Rehabilitation office.</p>  </div>  <h2>What types of accommodations should be considered?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Accommodations for employees with arthritis may be administrative or mechanical in nature. Administrative accommodations may include reassigning or reallocating marginal duties, being flexible about how or when tasks are performed, and allowing a flexible work schedule or telecommuting. Reassignment to a different, available job is also an option if no other accommodation is effective.</p>  <p>Mechanical accommodations include modifying the employee&rsquo;s workstation, modifying or providing special tools or equipment, and ensuring that the building, the work area, and other non-work areas used by employees, such as restrooms and break rooms, are accessible.</p>  <p>For example, an employee with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees may have difficulty standing all day. Providing a stool of the appropriate height would allow the individual to alternate between sitting and standing at a workstation without interrupting production. Another person may have difficulty sitting for long periods. If s/he works at a desk, a podium could be used to raise the work surface allowing the employee to change positions as needed.</p>  <p>More significant accommodations for an individual with arthritis in the lower extremities could include moving a workstation to a ground floor to alleviate the need to climb stairs, or providing another employee to assist with lifting or other physically demanding non-essential tasks.</p>  <p>Arthritis in the hands and arms can be particularly problematic for an individual whose job requires repetitive hand function such as factory assembly or typing. There are a number of adaptive tools available to assist individuals with grasping and manipulating objects. These tools may be especially effective if the individual has arthritis in only one hand. Moving the individual from a job requiring finger manipulations to one requiring gross handling may be an alternative for some individuals. Computer technology provides a number of alternatives for individuals with arthritis in the upper extremities. Adaptive keyboards that reduce stress on the arms are available through most computer dealers. Additionally, a number of voice-activated computer software packages are available to reduce the amount of actual typing the individual must perform. These programs are fairly inexpensive and user-friendly.</p>  <p>Some individuals with arthritis have more difficulty in the morning. Providing a flexible work schedule allowing the employee to start work later in the morning may significantly improve the individual&rsquo;s ability to perform work functions. Many employers allow employees to work from home. This allows employees to set a schedule that best fits their needs and provides the opportunity to change positions and take breaks when needed.</p>  <p>These are only a few examples of appropriate accommodations for employees with arthritis. Many accommodations can be achieved with little cost to the employer and minimal disruption of the work site. Generally, the cost of the accommodation is far less than the cost of disability payments.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Christy Clark, M.Ed. with editorial assistance from Dianna Borsi O\'Brien, M.A.',NULL,143,'Christy Clark, M.Ed., Graduate Research Assistant, Missouri Arthritis Rehabilitation Research and Training Center  Dianna Borsi O\'Brien, M.A., Senior Information Specialist, Missouri Arthritis Rehabilitation Research and Training Center',NULL,'January, 2001 ',NULL),(27,'Definition of Disability','Definition of Disability Under the ADA:  A Practical Overview and Update',1,'<h2>Introduction</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The first issue in almost all cases arising under Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is whether the plaintiff has a &ldquo;disability.&rdquo; Because the U.S. Congress crafted the definition of disability in Title I of the ADA in order to eliminate discrimination in the workplace, it may differ from the definition of disability used in other federal, state and local statutes. The ADA defines disabil&shy;ity as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activ&shy;ity; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impair&shy;ment. Numerous court cases have been dismissed based upon a finding that the individual filing suit did not have a disability as defined under the ADA.</p>  <p>When an employer is presented with a request for accommodation or other action required by the ADA, the issue of whether the individual has an ADA disability is often an important threshold question. At times, the impairment may clearly qualify as an ADA disability. In other situations, variables such as the severity or duration of the impairment may make ADA coverage uncertain. Where it is a close call, an employer with good human resources management may skip ahead to the issue of reasonable accommodation. If the employer is able to accommodate the individual&rsquo;s request without undue cost or disruption, it may choose to do so as a smart employment practice, regardless of whether the ADA applies.</p>  <h2>What is an ADA Impairment?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Generally, whether an individual has an ADA impairment is reasonably clear. It will not likely lead to litigation if the impairment is obvious or if there is a documented diagnosis combined with a substantial limitation of a major life activity. An &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; may be physiological, mental, or psychological. The ADA broadly defines the term &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; as any physiological disorder or condition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the body&rsquo;s multiple systems, including the special sense organs, neurological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, geni&shy;to-urinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin and endocrine systems. The ADA further defines &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; as any mental or psychological disorder, such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, and specific learning disabilities. Neither the statute nor regulations interpreting and imple&shy;menting the ADA attempt to list all covered disorders or conditions. A comprehensive listing would be almost impossible, given the number and variety of possible impairments.</p>  <p>The definition of impairment does not include physical characteristics (e.g., left-handedness or normal height or weight deviations), com&shy;mon personality traits (e.g., a quick temper), pregnancy, and cultural or economic disad&shy;vantages. There are also certain statutory exclusions from the definition of disability, including individuals engaged in the current use of illegal drugs when the employer acts on the basis of such use.</p>  <h2>What is a Major Life Activity?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">Once it is determined that an individual has an impairment as defined by the ADA, one must determine whether that impairment sub&shy;stantially limits a major life activity. As origi&shy;nally enacted in 1990, the ADA did not elabo&shy;rate upon the meaning of the term &ldquo;major life activity.&rdquo; EEOC regulations implementing the ADA did state, however, that functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working are major life activi&shy;ties. Since the early 1990&rsquo;s, federal courts have identified additional major life activities, such as sitting, standing, bending, communicating, lifting, reaching, sleeping, eating, reading and mental/emotional processes such as thinking, concentrating and interacting with others. All of the major life activities mentioned above are now specifically included in the ADA defini&shy;tion of major life activities due to the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA). In ad&shy;dition, Congress broadened the definition of major life activities to include the operation of major bodily functions, such as: the functions of the immune system; normal cell growth; and digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine and reproductive functions.</div>  <p>The changes in the ADA definition of major life activity are of utmost importance to em&shy;ployers trying to determine whether employ&shy;ees and/or applicants constitute individuals with disabilities entitled to accommodations under the ADA. Since the ADA was first en&shy;acted, there has been a great deal of litigation examining what constitutes life&rsquo;s major activi&shy;ties. Courts have not always agreed with what the EEOC or other courts identified as major life activities, and thus, some jurisdictions may have ruled that activities now specifi&shy;cally identified as major life activities were not classified as such. Employers must evaluate each new case on an individual basis in light of the ADAAA, keeping in mind that the list of activities in the ADA is non-exhaustive.</p>  <h2>What Does Substantially Limits Mean?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The ADA does not explicitly define the term &ldquo;substantially limits.&rdquo; As a result, its meaning has been the subject of debate and litigation since the ADA was first enacted, and individu&shy;als need to be familiar with pre-ADAAA inter&shy;pretations of that term in order to understand how courts may interpret it today.</p>  <p>Prior to the ADAAA, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that, in order to be &ldquo;substantially&rdquo; limit&shy;ing, an impairment must prevent or severely restrict an individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people&rsquo;s daily lives. Similarly, the EEOC regulations stated that an impairment would be consid&shy;ered substantially limiting if an individual could not perform, or was significantly limited in the ability to perform, an activity as com&shy;pared with an average person in the general population. Both bodies of law adopted the principle that intermittent impairments are not substantially limiting.</p>  <p>When Congress passed the ADAAA, it stated among its findings that these interpretations of &ldquo;substantially limiting&rdquo; expressed too high a standard for plaintiffs to prove. It did not, however, adopt a new definition of the term \"substantially limits.\" Thus, in this ADAAA era, an individual&rsquo;s impairment must limit one or more major life activities in a substan&shy;tial manner, but need not limit that major life activity in a severely restrictive fashion, in order for the impairment to qualify as an ADA disability. Some impairments, for example, blindness or deafness, are inherently substan&shy;tially limiting. Others, however, may or may not be disabling depending on their impact on that particular individual&rsquo;s functioning, as compared to that of the average person. In determining the extent of one&rsquo;s limitation, the nature, severity, duration, and impact of the impairment are relevant factors.</p>  <p>Courts may examine the activities the em&shy;ployee or applicant is able to perform in deter&shy;mining whether s/he is actually substantially limited. For example, in one case the court found that the plaintiff was not substantially limited in walking, noting that the plaintiff lived an active lifestyle, could hunt, fish and play eighteen holes of golf as well as anyone, march double time and run a mile and a half in 15 minutes.</p>  <p>In terms of duration, the ADA does not specify the exact length of time that an impairment must last in order to be considered substan&shy;tially limiting. Short-term impairments with no long-term or permanent effects, however, would not likely be considered &ldquo;substantially limiting.&rdquo; The trick is in defining short-term. Language in the ADAAA suggests that six months may be an appropriate benchmark for determining whether an impairment is short or long-term. As always, each case should be considered based upon its own unique facts and circumstances.</p>  <p>When the exact duration of a medical condi&shy;tion cannot be predicted, the EEOC suggests that the condition may qualify as a disability if it is severe and has an indefinite and unknow&shy;able duration. Chronic conditions that are substantially limiting when active may also be disabilities. This would include, for example, episodic conditions such as bi-polar disorder. A temporary impairment that may have per&shy;manent or residual long-term effects, such as a concussion resulting in permanent brain dam&shy;age, may also rise to the level of disability.</p>  <p>In short, an impairment or its resultant effects must be sufficiently severe and sufficiently long-term to rise to the level of disability, but it need not be permanent.</p>  <h2>What About Mitigating Measures?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">The position initially taken in the EEOC regu&shy;lations, and followed by many courts, was that mitigating measures such as medication or prosthetic devices should not be consid&shy;ered in determining whether an individual&rsquo;s impairment rises to the level of disability. In a series of three decisions filed in 1999, the Supreme Court ruled to the contrary, holding that impairments that would otherwise qualify as disabilities under the ADA would never&shy;theless fail to qualify if mitigating measures lessened the impact of that impairment upon the major life activity at issue. The Court held that a disability exists only when an impair&shy;ment substantially limits a major life activity, not where it &ldquo;might,&rdquo; &ldquo; could,&rdquo; or &ldquo;would&rdquo; be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken.</div>  <p>Congress rejected the Supreme Court&rsquo;s inter&shy;pretation of the ADA regarding mitigating measures when it passed the ADAAA, which explicitly requires that impairments be consid&shy;ered in their unmitigated state (except in the case of ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses) when determining whether such impairment rises to the level of an ADA disability. Thus, a person with a hearing impairment, for ex&shy; ex&shy;ample, who uses hearing aids will qualify as an individual with an ADA disability under current law, even if he or she can hear as well as the general populace when using hearing aids.</p>  <p>This is an additional circumstance in which employers must exercise great care in deciding whether an employee/applicant is eligible for ADA protections. Indeed, certain mitigated impairments that courts concluded were not ADA disabilities prior to the ADAAA may now constitute ADA disabilities in light of this new law.</p>  <h2>Disabled in Working</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The major life activity of &ldquo;working&rdquo; has been historically one of the more difficult major life activities to identify. Although working was not mentioned as a major life activity in the ADA as originally enacted, the ADAAA spe&shy;cifically includes &ldquo;working&rdquo; in its non-exhaus&shy;tive list of major life activities.</p>  <p>The ADAAA does not provide any further guidance, however, as to the proof required to show that an impairment substantially limits one&rsquo;s ability to work. EEOC regulations and instructions enacted before the ADAAA state that its investigators initially should determine whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity other than working. It instructs investigators to consider the activity of working only if the impairment does not significantly limit any other major life activity.</p>  <p>A person is substantially limited in the major life activity of working if s/he is significantly restricted in the ability to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared with the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities. The geographical area to which the person has rea&shy;sonable access is considered, as is the number of jobs requiring similar skills and abilities (class) and dissimilar skills and abilities (broad range). Proof that an individual cannot per&shy;form a single, particular job is not sufficient. In addition, the inability to work for a particu&shy;lar supervisor or in a particular building does not rise to the level of being unable to perform a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in vari&shy;ous classes.</p>  <p>EEOC has stated that a class of jobs could include a category like heavy labor jobs (e.g., a laborer with a back condition that precludes heavy lifting), jobs requiring the use of a com&shy;puter (e.g., a person with a visual impairment that precludes them from reading off a com&shy;puter screen), or clerical jobs.</p>  <p>EEOC has also given examples of when a per&shy;son is restricted in performing a &ldquo;broad range of jobs.&rdquo; These include someone precluded by allergy from working in all high-rise buildings and someone precluded because of a hearing impairment from working in all noisy environ&shy;ments like carpentry, auto repair, demolitions and airport grounds work.</p>  <p>There has been a lot of litigation on this is&shy;sue. For example, one court analyzed whether an employee&rsquo;s tendonitis, which precluded her from working in jobs involving repetitive hand motions, substantially limited a class or broad range of jobs. The court found that the restrictions precluded the employee from a wide group of jobs in the metropolitan area, including virtually any assembly line job that required repetitive movement. In another case, the court considered whether a &ldquo;roof bolter&rdquo; with a shoulder injury was substan&shy;tially limited in working when he could not perform overhead work, heavy lifting, or pull&shy;ing and pushing out from his body. The court stated that this injury could pose a substantial limitation in working because it might apply to a broad range of jobs, including any posi&shy;tion in at the coal mine or in related work such as construction. Another important point is that courts some&shy;times seem to focus on what jobs the person can still do in determining whether the person is disabled in working, which is not part of the EEOC&rsquo;s analysis. For example, in one case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiff was not substantially limited in working, noting that there were many other jobs the plaintiff could perform, including mechanic jobs not requir&shy;ing DOT certification.</p>  <p>Now that the definition of major life activity includes major bodily functions and mitigat&shy;ing factors are not considered in determining whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity, one would assume that major life activities other than working will more often be applicable. If that is the case, the struggle to interpret whether the major life activity of working has been substantially limited will occur less often.</p>  <h2>Record of Disability</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The second prong of the definition of disability covers persons who have a history of, or have been classified or misclassified as having, a physical or mental impairment that substantially limited one or more major life activities.</p>  <p>Example: Several years ago, an individual experienced a severe form of depression that made it impossible to function in day-to-day life. Her condition necessitated a month of hospitalization and a year of outpatient treatment, including psychotherapy and medication. She has now made a full recovery. This person has a record of disability under the ADA.</p>  <p>Note that an individual who has a record of disability under other laws or regulations does not necessarily have a record of disability under the ADA. For example, a finding of disability under workers&rsquo; compensation laws does not necessarily equate to an ADA disability.</p>  <h2>Regarded as Disabled</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Based upon language adopted in the ADAAA, an individual is &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; disabled if s/he establishes that s/he was subjected to an ac&shy;tion prohibited under the ADA because of an actual or perceived physical or mental impair&shy;ment, whether or not the impairment limits or is perceived to limit a major life activity. Be&shy;fore the passage of the ADAAA, many courts applied the &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; prong of the disabil&shy;ity definition much more narrowly, requiring that an individual&rsquo;s impairment limit a major life activity, regardless whether it was per&shy;ceived or actual. That former interpretation of the law no longer applies.</p>  <p>The ADAAA limits applicability of the &ldquo;re&shy;garded as&rdquo; prong in two important ways. First, it states that this prong of the disability definition does not apply to impairments that are transitory or minor, meaning an impair&shy;ment that has an actual or expected dura&shy;tion of six months or less (a broken leg, for example). Second, while the ADA prohibits employers from taking adverse employment action against an employee or applicant that it &ldquo;regards&rdquo; as disabled, it does not require the employer to accommodate such individual. Thus, the degree of protection afforded an employee or applicant under this prong of the disability definition is less than that under the other two prongs (i.e., where the individual has a disability or a record thereof).</p>  <p>A person may have a claim under this third prong of the disability definition in a number of different circumstances. First, an employer regards its employee/applicant as disabled if it mistakenly believes that s/he has a disabil&shy;ity. Second, a person may have an impairment that is not substantially limiting (and thus not a disability). But, if the employer treats that impairment as though it is substantially limit&shy;ing, it has regarded the individual as disabled. Finally, an impairment can be physically limiting only because of the attitudes of oth&shy;ers, such as a situation in which an individual has severe facial scars from an accident. If the employer refuses to put this person in a cus&shy;tomer service position, despite his/her ability to do the job, because of a concern for public reaction, it has regarded the individual as disabled.</p>  <p>The EEOC has stated that an employer&rsquo;s knowledge of an impairment (or perceived impairment) is critical in &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; cases. Courts have also adopted this position. For example, one court rejected the employee&rsquo;s &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; claim because the employee produced no evidence that supervisors and management were aware that she had a men&shy;tal impairment diagnosis. On the other hand, an employer&rsquo;s awareness of an employee&rsquo;s impairment is not enough by itself to demon&shy;strate that the employer regarded the employ&shy;ee as disabled or that the perception caused the adverse employment action.</p>  <h2>Regarded as Disabled in Working</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>If an employer regards an employee or ap&shy;plicant as having an impairment that affects &ldquo;work,&rdquo; that individual would need to show that the employer perceived him/her as be&shy;ing prevented from, or substantially limited in, working in a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes (not just one job or a narrow class of jobs). The EEOC has taken the position that it will analyze these cases by looking at the criterion that the employer has used to disqualify the individual and deter&shy;mine whether the criteria applies to one par&shy;ticular job or to a class or broad range of jobs. Such criteria might include:</p>  <p>&bull; vision or hearing standards</p>  <p>&bull; ability to lift certain weights</p>  <p>&bull; working at certain heights</p>  <p>&bull; working with certain tools, equipment or substances</p>  <p>&bull; ability to work under high stress situa&shy;tions.</p>  <p>Note that the criteria need not be a formal requirement listed in a job description or elsewhere but rather is the reason that the employer thinks the person cannot do the job. The EEOC has stated that an employer can be liable under the &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; section of the ADA only if it believes that the impairment precludes or restricts the person from meeting a qualification standard or criterion. This ap&shy;proach is also reflected in the case law.</p>  <p>For example, in one case the court determined that the employer believed that the employee could not handle the stress or hours of a su&shy;pervisory position following surgery for a brain tumor and demoted him. The court concluded that this employer regarded the employee as unable to perform a class of su&shy;pervisory jobs.</p>  <h2>Genetic Discrimination</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>The &ldquo;regarded as&rdquo; part of the definition of disability may protect an individual against discrimination based on genetic information relating to illness, disease or other disorders. For example, the EEOC has stated that if an employer withdraws a job offer based upon a person&rsquo;s medical history showing an increased susceptibility to colon cancer, because of the employer&rsquo;s concerns about matters such as productivity, insurance costs, and attendance, the employer would be regarding the person as having a substantially limiting impairment.</p>  <h2>Practical Tips on Determining Disability</h2>  <div class=\"section\">&nbsp;</div>  <p>Medical documentation is a good starting point for determining disability since it may include information on limitations related to an impairment. Generally, the individual with a disability will be able to describe his/her limitations. Friends, family members, supervi&shy;sors, rehabilitation counselors and occupation&shy;al or physical therapists may also have direct knowledge of a person&rsquo;s restrictions. The employer&rsquo;s own observations may also sup&shy;ply or confirm relevant information relating to disability.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>',NULL,NULL,'2014-04-11 03:30:48','This publication was written in September, 2001 by Sheila D.

','2001','2010'),(28,'Deaf/Hard of Hearing','Working Effectively with Persons Who Are Hard of Hearing, Late-Deafened, or Deaf',4,'<h2>Who is Considered Hard of Hearing or Deaf?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Hearing loss ranks with arthritis, high blood pressure, and heart disease as one of the most common health conditions. While it is true that the prevalence of hearing loss increases with age, with one out of three individuals over the age of 65 having difficulty hearing, the majority of people with hearing loss (60%) are working-age adults (i.e., 21 to 65 years of age). Approximately 36 million (17%) American adults report some form of hearing loss.<a href=\"\"#1\"\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>  <p>There are several systems for classifying people who have difficulty hearing. One method is the audiological classification, which classifies an individual based on his/her degree of hearing loss (i.e., minimal, mild, moderate, moderate to severe, severe, and profound). While this classification system provides an objective account of the severity of a person&rsquo;s hearing loss, it does not provide information about the day-to-day functioning of the person.</p>  <p>Another system is based on a functional classification. In this classification system, people who have hearing loss fall into three main subgroups: (1) those who are hard of hearing; (2) those who are deaf and became so in adulthood; (3) and those who are born deaf or became deaf early in life. Although these three groups all share impaired or absent hearing, they are very different in many ways and have a variety of different characteristics, needs, desires, and ways of communicating.</p>  <p>A major problem with the functional classification system is that there is frequently an overlap between categories, with many individuals fitting into more than one category. For example, there are individuals who were born profoundly deaf or acquired a profound hearing loss early in childhood but communicate using oral means rather than American Sign Language. In addition, an increasing number of individuals today have cochlear implants. When the implant device is turned off, they may be profoundly deaf; however, when the unit is turned on, they function as hard of hearing.</p>  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\"><hr />  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\">  <div id=\"\"1\"\"><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;See the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), one of the National Institutes of Health, at www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick.htm for more statistics.</div>  </div>  <h2>Hearing Loss and Understanding Speech</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>It is important to realize that understanding speech is the key issue, and that this is different from hearing other sounds. Many persons who can hear certain sounds, such as a door slamming or a car horn, are nevertheless unable to hear and understand speech, which is quieter and involves more complex patterns of sounds. Persons with hearing loss are often aware that someone is speaking, without necessarily being able to understand all of what is being said.</p>  <p>Moreover, the use of hearing aids does not &ldquo;fix&rdquo; a hearing loss in the same way that glasses &ldquo;fix&rdquo; a vision problem for most people. Hearing aids can often help to some degree, but they do not restore normal hearing in the way that glasses usually restore normal 20/20 vision. This is because hearing loss is not just about loudness, but also about the clarity or understandability of what comes through, even with hearing aids or other devices. The experience of listening with a hearing loss has sometimes been compared to listening to a very fuzzy, &ldquo;static-y&rdquo; radio, or to listening to a cell phone conversation in an area of poor reception, where the speech sounds &ldquo;break up&rdquo; or fade in and out randomly and unpredictably. Of course, for some people, those who are born deaf or become deaf as adults, the radio has effectively been turned off or turned to a pure static channel.</p>  </div>  <h2>Hearing Loss and the ADA</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Title I of the ADA protects qualified individuals with disabilities from employment discrimination. Under the ADA, an individual with a disability is a person who:</p>  <ul>  <li>Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;</li>  <li>Has a record of such an impairment; or</li>  <li>Is regarded as having such an impairment.</li>  </ul>  <p>&ldquo;Substantially limits&rdquo; means that the person is substantially limited in the ability to perform a major life activity compared to an average person in the general population. Major life activities include functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. Hearing loss is therefore a physical impairment that may substantially limit the major life activity of hearing, depending on the degree of severity. One determines whether an individual&rsquo;s hearing loss rises to the level of a disability under the ADA by examining the individual&rsquo;s specific impairment, without consideration of mitigating measures, such as medication, medical equipment or coping mechanisms.</p>  <p>In order to be protected under the ADA, the applicant or employee with a disability must also be qualified for the position held or desired. The ADA defines a qualified individual with a disability as a person with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment position and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job.</p>  <p>The ADA requires employers to provide necessary reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with a disability. A reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things usually are done that enables a qualified individual with a disability to enjoy an equal employment opportunity.</p>  <p>Reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities should be implemented, as necessary, in all phases of employment, including the selection process, training and orientation, performance of job tasks, meetings with co-workers and supervisors, career advancement and planning, business social events, and eventual resignation and retirement. An employer is not required to provide a reasonable accommodation, however, that would impose an undue hardship upon the operation of the business. To make this determination, one examines, among other things: the nature and net cost of the accommodation; the number of employees, type of operations, and financial resources of the facility and the larger business entity of which it may be a part; and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility. Generally, the concept of undue hardship encompasses actions that are unduly costly or disruptive.</p>  <p>An employer is also not required to provide an accommodation that is primarily for personal use (e.g., hearing aid or cochlear implant). Reasonable accommodations refer to modifications or provisions that specifically assist an individual in performing the designated duties of a particular job. If a person does not own a hearing aid or cannot benefit from a hearing aid, then the employer may be required to provide a reasonable accommodation that will enable effective communication within the workplace and allow the employee to perform his or her job.</p>  </div>  <h2>Working with Persons Who Are Hard of Hearing</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>The term &ldquo;hard of hearing&rdquo; refers to a hearing loss from 25 decibels (abbreviated &ldquo;dB&rdquo;), which is a mild loss, to about 90 dB (a severe loss). Persons who are hard of hearing represent roughly 26 million people, or about 93% of all people who have some hearing loss. Although a hearing loss in the hard of hearing range can begin at any age, the majority of such losses begin in adulthood, often between the ages of 30 and 40. The percentage of people with hearing loss increases with age. Many such hearing losses are progressive, meaning that they may begin as a loss in the mild-to-moderate range, and become more severe as the years go by. Occasionally, a person&rsquo;s hearing ability drops suddenly, but more often the progression is slow and gradual, occurring over a period of years. Frequently, the person with a progressive hearing loss will not be aware initially of his or her own hearing loss until it reaches a level at which communication difficulties become apparent. Often, it is family and friends who first begin to notice that something is not quite &ldquo;right&rdquo; based upon the person&rsquo;s inappropriate responses &ndash; or failure to respond &ndash; in communication situations. It is partly for this reason that people with hearing loss wait an average of seven years before seeking help.</p>  <p>An individual with a hearing loss in the hard of hearing range usually communicates using a combination of strategies that rely on the person&rsquo;s remaining degree of hearing ability, perhaps enhanced by a hearing aid or an &ldquo;assistive listening device&rdquo; (discussed below), and supplemented by speech-reading (lip-reading) or other visual means as the loss moves toward the severe end of the spectrum.</p>  <p><strong>Hearing ability varies according to the situation:</strong></p>  <p>Something that is hard for most people to understand and appreciate is that, for persons who are hard of hearing, the ability to hear is very dependent upon the specifics of the situation. A person who is hard of hearing may be able to communicate and understand very well in a one-to-one meeting in a quiet, well-lighted but glare-free room, and when rested and calm. The same person may have great difficulty understanding during a group meeting, when several people are talking, where there is background noise (e.g., air-conditioning or ventilation systems that are noisy), when the speaker is standing or sitting at a distance, when the speaker is speaking softly or rapidly, or speaks with a foreign accent, where there is glare or poor lighting, and/or when s/he is fatigued or stressed. Thus, an important factor in working with people who are hard of hearing is to determine how favorable the specific situation is for that individual, and what changes might improve the situation. For example, participants in a group meeting might be asked to speak only one at a time and to be sure the person who is hard of hearing knows who is speaking. Seating might be rearranged so the person who has a hearing loss is nearer to the speaker(s) and does not have to look at speakers who are back-lighted against a window or other source of glare. In addition, written material for discussion should be presented in advance, such as the meeting agenda, course materials, and names of participants. Sometimes, simply having the individual with the hearing loss sitting next to a good (and legible) note taker can help fill in the gaps, if information is missed. Inevitably, the person who is hard of hearing sometimes will miss something and will ask for a clarification. If a simple repetition does not work the first time, it is important to re-phrase the comment rather than to frustrate all involved with multiple verbatim repetitions that still don&rsquo;t help. If all else fails, a quick written note may save the day. It is particularly disrespectful and often offensive to say, &ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t important,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really matter.&rdquo; The person who is hard of hearing wants and is entitled to be included in the conversation as much as anyone else. These are simple accommodations that can make a large difference in understanding for the person who is hard of hearing. In fact, many of these accommodations are potentially beneficial to all employees, not just those who are hard of hearing.</p>  <p><strong>Speech-reading (lip-reading):</strong></p>  <p>On the one hand, speech-reading (often also called lip-reading) can be a valuable tool to assist a person who is hard of hearing or deaf to understand more of what is being said. On the other hand, there is a lot of &ldquo;mythology&rdquo; about this subject, which often implies that speech-reading can be an avenue to full understanding of a conversation, and that all persons with hearing loss are somehow automatically able to speech-read. Speech-reading is a skill that can be learned, but like all skills, there is great variability from person to person in how well they can learn or use that skill. One fundamental fact is that many speech sounds are made in the mouth or throat and are not at all visible externally (for example, &ldquo;uh&rdquo; or &ldquo;k&rdquo;). Another fundamental fact is that different sounds that are visible look the same on the lips (for example, &ldquo;b&rdquo; versus &ldquo;p&rdquo;). As a result, even a perfect speech-reader can actually &ldquo;see&rdquo; only about half of what is said. A person with excellent speech-reading skills can sometimes &ldquo;fill in some of the blanks&rdquo; by knowing the context of the situation or conversation, or because of general knowledge of the world (for example, in &ldquo;the dog was ****ing loudly,&rdquo; chances are the missing word is &ldquo;bark&rdquo;). In general, while speech-reading can be a useful in some conversations, it cannot be relied on to carry the full weight of a conversation, either for the person with hearing loss or for that person&rsquo;s conversational partner(s).</p>  <p><strong>Assistive listening devices:</strong></p>  <p>Certain accommodations involve various kinds of &ldquo;assistive listening devices.&rdquo; A common example is an amplified telephone handset for a worker who is hard of hearing, but still able to use the telephone. Another example is a hearing-aid-compatible phone. Many hearing aids have what is known as a &ldquo;telecoil&rdquo; or &ldquo;t-switch&rdquo; that improves the ability to hear on the telephone &ndash; but only if the phone is designed to be compatible with hearing aids. Federal regulations have made almost all wire-line phones hearing aid compatible, but the situation is less consistent with cordless and cellular phones.</p>  <p>Individuals whose hearing loss is more severe, and who have difficulty using the telephone even with a &ldquo;t-switch&rdquo; or an amplified handset, may elect to use a text telephone (frequently referred to as a TTY or TDD). Such devices include a keyboard, like a computer or typewriter, and allow communication over the telephone lines with anyone else who also has a text telephone. To allow communication between persons who use a text telephone and those who do not have such a device, every state has a telephone relay system. Such systems provide an intermediate operator who transfers printed text to speech and vice versa in order to make a telephone conversation possible. TTY calls can also be made using internet-based relay services. When using a PC or wireless device, calls can be made over the Internet using the relay service without the use of a TTY device. Relay service is a free service through which individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing can communicate with individuals who are hearing who don&rsquo;t have TTYs.</p>  <p>Some individuals with hearing loss who prefer to use their own voice when talking on the phone may feel more comfortable using a &ldquo;voice carry over&rdquo; (VCO) phone. This type of phone device receives TTY messages directly from the caller or via the relay service, but the individual with the hearing loss responds to the caller using his or her own voice rather than typing.</p>  <p>Another phone option for individuals who have hearing loss and prefer to use their own voice rather than communicate via a text is a &ldquo;captioned phone.&rdquo; This phone works like a standard phone but it displays live captions of the conversation. When a call is initiated or received, the phone automatically connects to a captioning service where a trained operator transcribes what is being said using voice recognition technology. The individual who is deaf or hard of hearing responds using speech. The person on the other end of the line does not need any special equipment or need to use the relay service to initiate a call. This service is also available over the Internet.</p>  <p>For individuals who are deaf who prefer to communicate on the telephone using sign language rather than text, a variety of options now exist. Video relay calls are made using the Internet and a videophone connected to either a TV or through a personal computer equipped with a Web camera and video relay software. The individual who is deaf signs to a video interpreter who then communicates using speech with the hearing person via a standard phone line.</p>  <p>Further information about these and similar systems, their availability, and (usually modest) cost can be obtained from the resources listed later in this brochure.</p>  <p>Other assistive listening devices, such as magnetic induction loops, FM systems, and infrared systems are designed to improve the ability to hear in group or audience situations. Some individuals who are hard of hearing may wish to use personal portable amplification devices, perhaps with a directional microphone. These are especially helpful when there is background noise or many speakers, such as in a restaurant or company lunchroom.</p>  </div>  <h2>Working with Persons Who Became Deaf as Adults (&ldquo;Late-Deafened&rdquo;):</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>The term &ldquo;deaf&rdquo; generally refers to a hearing loss greater than 90 dB (profound hearing loss). Persons are generally considered &ldquo;deaf&rdquo; if they are unable to hear and understand speech (even with a hearing aid), and so must rely on vision for communication. Persons who become deaf in adulthood are often called &ldquo;late-deafened&rdquo; to distinguish them from persons who were born deaf or who became deaf early in life. Deafness beginning in adulthood is a low prevalence condition, believed to affect approximately 1.5 million persons in the US. Because of their dependence on the visual mode for communication, their situation is very different from that of persons who are hard of hearing.</p>  <p>Persons who are late-deafened generally have easy-to-understand speech because they grew up as hearing persons and learned spoken language as children. They are also generally comfortable communicating via print, whether by writing notes, on a computer, or by captioning (more on this below). Some late-deafened persons also use a form of sign language that is closely based on English.</p>  <p>Although some late-deafened persons continue to use hearing aids to assist with environmental sounds or awareness that someone is speaking, by definition they are not generally able to hear and understand speech even with such assistance. Most late-deafened persons will therefore use a text telephone or TTY or VCO phone, will depend on speech-reading or lip-reading (though this is generally a very limited and unsatisfactory means of communication on its own), and will need some form of print or visual communication to interact with others. Because of their reliance on vision for communication, the points made above about proper lighting, avoidance of glare, and good sight lines become even more critical. For group or audience situations, there is an important service known as CART (Computer Assisted Real-Time Transcription). A CART-trained court reporter uses a stenotype machine (like that used to record proceedings in the law courts) connected to a laptop computer and a projector. As each speaker speaks, the CART operator keyboards what is being said, the computer translates the keystrokes into printed words, and the projector projects the resulting text onto either a screen or laptop monitor that can be seen by the late-deafened person. With a skilled operator, this system provides essentially real-time access to a spoken conversation for the person who is late-deafened. Remote CART or &ldquo;online captioning&rdquo; is also now available. The individual with a hearing loss connects a computer to the Internet, and then connects to the CART captionist who, using a stenograph machine, is located off site, listens to the meeting through a telephone or computer-connected microphone, and instantly sends the live text to the employee&rsquo;s computer through the Internet.</p>  </div>  <h2>Working with Persons Who Became Deaf Early in Life:</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>If a person is born deaf, or becomes deaf very early in life before learning to speak fluently (before about age three), the impact of the deafness on language and speech is much more profound than if the loss occurs later in life. Children learn to speak a native language by hearing others speak it, and by hearing their own voice as they learn to produce the words and phrases of that language during the first years of life. If deafness intervenes at this early stage, the individual never learns what the language sounds like, as spoken by others or by themselves. As a result, despite average or above average intelligence, the individual may never fully master the language the way a native speaker does, either in spoken communication or in reading and writing the language. This set of facts determines the communication needs and preferences of persons with early onset deafness. Written notes and company memos are often expressed in a level of English that is easy and natural for native English speakers, but that can be very difficult for persons who are born deaf (and for other non-native speakers of the language).</p>  <p>In the United States, persons who are born deaf or lose their hearing at an early age generally prefer to communicate using American Sign Language (ASL). Those persons who use ASL and become members of the community of persons who are deaf are now commonly referred to as &ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; (with a capital &ldquo;D&rdquo;). There are also some individuals who have been born deaf, but who do not know sign language, and who communicate using oral means (speaking and speech-reading). When communicating at work with an individual who is Deaf and relies on ASL to communicate, it is often appropriate to employ the assistance of a professional sign language interpreter. Other appropriate measures include providing note-takers (one cannot use vision to watch a speaker or sign language interpreter and simultaneously use vision to write notes), providing basic sign language classes for hearing co-workers and supervisors, and ensuring that written company documents are understood by the Deaf person whose command of English may not be equivalent to that of a native speaker.</p>  </div>  <h2>On-the-job needs for anyone who is hard of hearing, late deafened, or Deaf:</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>On the job, the key issue is to determine the communication needs and preferences of the person who is hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf, and then to provide the necessary communication assistance. As discussed above, communication assistance may involve technological devices and/or communication supportive services such as interpreters or CART operators. Whether communication assistance is provided as a reasonable accommodation required under the ADA or whether an employer voluntarily provides an accommodation in order to help an employee with a minimal degree of hearing loss perform at his/ her full potential, the employer is engaging in good business practices. Human resources policies that maximize every person&rsquo;s potential and keep valued employees in the workforce contribute to a company&rsquo;s success.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Type of Jobs Are Held By Persons Who Are Hard of Hearing, Late-Deafened, or Deaf?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf can perform the majority of jobs available. However, factors that create communication barriers can limit their participation or success in the workplace. These factors include physical and environmental barriers such as noise, light and glare levels within a room, and distance from the speaker. Attitudinal barriers can also limit the job participation or success of persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf. Such barriers include stereotyping, ignorance, and a focus on disabilities (limitations) rather than abilities (strengths).</p>  <p>With few exceptions, persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf, when given appropriate training and accommodations, have the same range of job options as any other person. There are indeed no jobs that are just for persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf. They are employed in as diverse a range of jobs as are people who hear. In recent years, several have been successful in high profile jobs that require excellent communication skills, including screen actors (Marlee Matlin) and President of the United States (Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton).</p>  <p>Given their capabilities and the provision of appropriate communication accommodations, persons with hearing losses can be productive employees in most any job. Persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf have been successful as architects, artists, computer programmers, managers, entrepreneurs, physicians, psychologists, lawyers, teachers, telecommunications technicians, and judges, as well as many other positions.</p>  <p>Success on the job depends largely on the skills and attitudes of the worker, as well as on the willingness and ability of the employer to identify and resolve communication barriers encountered in the workplace. Appropriate accommodations can be implemented in all phases of employment, from participation in the selection process to training and advancement. Once an employer learns that an applicant or an employee is hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf and in need of an accommodation, the employer needs to be aware of its potential obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as the benefits of keeping all of its employees performing productively.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodating the Person Who is Hard of Hearing, Late-Deafened, or Deaf During the Employee Selection Process</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>During the selection process, employers must determine if the hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf person is capable of performing the essential functions of the job. It is critical to obtain an accurate picture of the applicant and his/her background, skills, and abilities to do the job. Typically, this process involves two steps: screening written job applications and interviewing prospective applicants.</p>  <p>Some applicants who are Deaf may have difficulty in reading and comprehending written applications, especially those that are heavily loaded with complicated English phrases or unfamiliar terms (note that this is not likely to be a problem with persons who are hard of hearing or late-deafened). Appropriate accommodations in this case may include such strategies as allowing the person to take an application and obtain their own assistance in filling it out, allowing more time for completion, or providing a sign language interpreter. When an applicant notifies you about their hearing loss, the simplest strategy is to ask the applicant what appropriate accommodations are needed.</p>  <p>Accommodations may also be required during selection interviews. At a minimum, interviewers should be sensitive to the range of communication abilities of persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf. Simple accommodations may include conducting the interview in a quiet, well-lit environment with minimal visual or auditory distractions. The interviewer must be willing to use the interviewee&rsquo;s assistive listening device (such as a portable microphone), if one is used. Talk at a normal pace and at a normal volume. If asked, be willing to converse at a different pace or volume, or to try other strategies like note-writing. If asked to repeat a question or comment, do so. If the interviewee asks for a second repetition, it is usually not helpful to repeat the exact same words or phrases yet again; instead, rephrase the question or comment in other words. Avoid sitting in front of bright lights, windows, or other sources of glare, which make it difficult to see the face and thus to speech-read.</p>  <p>If requested, use an effective professional sign language interpreter or CART operator. When using either of these services, speak directly to the applicant, not to the interpreter or CART operator. The role of the interpreter or CART operator is to facilitate communication, not to explain or to participate in the interview. All information shared in the interview is confidential, and will not be disclosed by the interpreter or CART operator to other parties. Referrals for professional sign language interpreters or CART operators may be obtained from public or private agencies such as the local office of the state Vocational Rehabilitation department, the state commission for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing (if there is one), or by consulting the telephone directory (under &ldquo;Translators and Interpreters,&rdquo; &ldquo;Transcribing Services,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Reporters &ndash; Court&rdquo;).</p>  <p>If group interviews are conducted, it is very important that only one person speaks at a time. Be sure the person who is hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf knows who is about to speak before that individual begins speaking. The goal in a job selection interview is to obtain an accurate picture of the person&rsquo;s skills, experiences, and capabilities to do the job. The interviewer should be alert for communication difficulties and take steps to address any that might arise so that important information about the applicant is not obscured or completely missed.</p>  </div>  <h2>Enhancing Productivity on the Job</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Research has also documented that employers frequently rate persons who are hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf as better or about the same as hearing co-workers in task performance (e.g., quality/quantity of output, attendance, safety, working without supervision). Workers give themselves similar ratings. However, both groups prioritized the following factors as critical to job retention and advancement:</p>  <ul>  <li>Access to periodic training to upgrade skills</li>  <li>Access to staff meetings and small group meetings</li>  <li>Reassignment of job duties if necessary to accommodate the hearing loss</li>  <li>Use of interpreters or CART operators</li>  <li>Availability of amplified telephone handsets/headsets and/or text telephones (TTY or TDD) and other assistive listening devices (ALDs)</li>  <li>Rearranging rooms to insure good visual communication and to minimize conflicting noise</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>On-the-Job Accommodations to Enhance Communication</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Enhancing the performance of the employee who is hard of hearing, late-deafened, or Deaf does not necessarily have to be expensive or require a great deal of equipment. In many instances, communication accommodations may be useful to all employees, not just those who have a hearing loss. The first step is to identify the communication situations in which the employee with a hearing loss is experiencing difficulty. The responsibility to improve the situation and minimize communication barriers in these situations is equally shared by all persons in the workplace, that is, those who are hearing, hard of hearing, late-deafened, and/or Deaf. The following are examples of accommodations that can facilitate communication in a variety of situations.</p>  <p><strong>Face-to-Face Situations </strong></p>  <ul>  <li>Ensure that the office and/or work environment is adequately lighted and without glare that could impede communication</li>  <li>Consider moving the worker to a quieter environment if environmental noise interferes with communication</li>  <li>Arrange the office or work station in such a way that the worker can readily see when someone is entering their office or workplace (i.e., no reliance on hearing someone coming up from behind)</li>  <li>Use assistive listening devices when needed</li>  <li>Use interpreters (oral and/or sign language) and CART operators when needed</li>  <li>Be aware of, and modify, your personal habits that may serve as barriers to comfortable speech-reading. Examples include placing your hands in front of your mouth, chewing while talking, not facing the employee, or wearing a mustache or beard that obscures the lips</li>  <li>Encourage co-workers and supervisors to become aware of and comfortable with equipment such as text telephones and assistive listening devices, and to learn sign language through employer-sponsored training classes</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Interactive Distance Communication Situations </strong></p>  <ul>  <li>Ensure the availability of text telephones (also known as TTYs or TDDs), telephone and other amplifying devices, or other appropriate assistive listening devices (ALDs) to help facilitate communication among employees and/or with customers</li>  <li>Use your state&rsquo;s Telecommunication Relay Services, where an intermediate operator receives verbal information and types it to the person using a text telephone, or vice versa. The &ldquo;800&rdquo; toll-free phone numbers for these services are listed in local phone directories.</li>  <li>Consider e-mail, text messaging, instant messaging, and FAX as an alternative for intra- and inter-office communication, and communication with customers</li>  <li>Provide visual or tactile pagers for communication, instructions, and as an alerting system</li>  <li>Share company information via computer networks</li>  <li>Use computers (especially laptops) for note-taking</li>  <li>Provide visual as well as auditory alerting devices on telephones and fire alarm systems</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Group Situations </strong></p>  <ul>  <li>Ensure that all rooms used for meetings or training sessions are adequately lighted and without glare</li>  <li>Utilize assistive listening devices such as FM transmitters/ receivers, infra-red systems, magnetic induction loop systems (for users of hearing aids that have telecoils or &ldquo;T-switches&rdquo;), and/or closed-captioning decoders on TVs used in meeting and training situations</li>  <li>Use real-time captioning (CART services) for meetings and training events</li>  <li>Ensure that video training materials (videotapes, DVDs, CDs, etc) are captioned</li>  <li>Use professional sign language and/or oral interpreters when needed</li>  <li>Use note-takers for meetings and group sessions</li>  <li>Consider using &ldquo;communication cops&rdquo; at meetings (one person who monitors the meeting to ensure that only one person speaks at a time)</li>  <li>Provide mentors and coaches</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Performance Evaluations </strong></p>  <p>Performance evaluations are typically based upon a written review coupled with a face-to-face interview. If reading ability necessitates extra time, provide workers with written information in advance. Because barrier-free communication is critical, use multiple strategies as necessary to ensure success. As described elsewhere in this document, multiple strategies might include the use of assistive listening devices, computers for note-taking, and professional sign language or oral interpreters.</p>  </div>  </div>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'University of Arkansas Research and  Training Center for Persons who are Deaf of Hard of Hearing','Carren J.

These disorders are intrinsic to the individual, presumed to be caused by central nervous system dysfunction, and they exist throughout the person&rsquo;s life. A learning disability is not a disorder that an individual \"grows out of.\" It is a permanent disorder that has a significant effect on learning but is not an indicator of intelligence. An individual with a learning disability may develop compensatory skills that help them to overcome the disability.</p>  <p>Problems in self-regulatory behaviors, social perceptions, and social integration may exist with learning disabilities but do not, by themselves, constitute learning disabilities. Although learning disabilities may occur concomitantly with other disabilities, they are not the result of those conditions or influences.</p>  <p>Learning disabilities affect some 10% of the American workforce. As a result, many persons applying for work or currently employed by an employer will have learning disabilities. These individuals are often intelligent, creative and productive.</p>  <p>Learning disabilities can sometimes cause inconsistent work performance and may require reasonable accommodation. Some learning disabilities may have a global effect on functioning in the workplace. Other individuals may only need a reasonable accommodation for a specific task.</p>  <p>Some common learning disability terminology is listed below:</p>  <p><b>Dyslexia</b> &ndash; difficulty with language processing, which, in turn, affects reading, writing, and spelling.<br /> <b>Dyspraxia</b> &ndash; difficulty with fine motor skills and coordination.<br /> <b>Dysgraphia</b> &ndash; difficulty with writing, spelling, and writing composition.<br /> <b>Auditory Discrimination</b> &ndash; difficulty in perceiving differences between speech sounds and sequencing these sounds into meaningful words, which affects reading and spoken language.<br /> <b>Visual Discrimination</b> &ndash; difficulty in noticing important details and assigning meaning to what is seen, which is critical to reading and writing.</p>  </div>  <h2>What is the Impact of the Americans with Disabilities Act on People with Learning Disabilities?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities. The term disability under the ADA is defined as:</p>  <ol>  <li>a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual,</li>  <li>a record of such an impairment or,</li>  <li>being regarded as having such an impairment.</li>  </ol>  <p>Learning disabilities are considered physical or mental impairments. The term &ldquo;Specific Learning Disabilities&rdquo; is cited in the regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces the ADA, implementing the employment provisions of the ADA (29 C.F.R. Part 1630). &ldquo;Substantially limits&rdquo; means that the person is unable to perform, or significantly limited in the ability to perform, an activity as compared with an average person in the general population. &ldquo;Major life activities&rdquo; refers to functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working.</p>  <p>Whether the ADA would protect a person with a learning disability from discrimination depends on whether the disability substantially limits a major life activity. For example, an employee whose auditory perception difficulties causes her to be unable to gain information from a staff meeting likely would have an ADA disability, especially where most employee would have little or no difficulty gaining relevant information from the meeting. By contrast, the inability to take excellent notes of a highly detailed, eight-hour technical discussion would not constitute a substantial impairment because the average person would also not be able to do this.</p>  <p>As the definition of disability makes plain, an employer also may not discrimination against an individual with a record of a disability or against someone perceived as disabled. For example, job applicants who have been through special education may not be discriminated against based on a school record of a disability. Similarly, employers also may not discriminate against applicants with learning disabilities because of a perception or fear that they cannot read.</p>  <p>An individual\'s limitations must be caused by a learning disability. Thus, an employee who is unable to read or write because he or she was never taught these skills, and not because of a learning disability, would not be an individual with a disability under the ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>Etiology of Learning Disabilities.</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>A learning disability is a developmental disorder that is usually present from birth, although it may go undetected until later in life. While genetic predisposition, perinatal injury, and various neurological or other medical conditions may be associated with the development of learning disabilities, the presence of such conditions does not invariably predict an eventual learning disability.</p>  <p>Some individuals with learning disabilities have no familial, medical, or environmental history that would predict a learning disorder.</p>  </div>  <h2>Potential Functional Limitations Caused by Learning Disabilities.</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Workers with learning disabilities may have difficulties with:</p>  <ul>  <li>Processing auditory material (e.g. receiving oral directions and other communication issues)</li>  <li>Writing, including issues with spelling, grammar, and/or sentence structure; or expressing information in a written format; and/or legible handwriting.</li>  <li>Reasoning ability regarding the comprehension of novel information, quantitative information, or complex verbal information.</li>  <li>Reading speed or reading comprehension.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Workplace Accommodations for Individuals with Learning Disabilities.</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Reasonable accommodations are by definition individualized in order to meet the needs of the specific applicant or employee. Some accommodations may include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Alternative print formats</li>  <li>Reduced-distraction work environments</li>  <li>Computer technology for written work</li>  <li>Reading materials presented in auditory formats</li>  <li>Extended time to learn job tasks or to perform work</li>  <li>Instructions presented both in written and oral formats</li>  <li>Allowing the employee to tape-record important information</li>  <li>Clearly defined job requirements, including the dates when projects assignments are due; advance notice of any changes</li>  <li>Providing handouts and visual aids</li>  <li>Using more than one way to demonstrate or explain information</li>  <li>Breaking information into small steps when teaching many new tasks in one lesson (state objectives, review previous lesson, summarize periodically)</li>  <li>Allowing time for clarification of directions and essential information</li>  <li>Providing assistance with the proofreading of written work</li>  <li>Allowing the use of spell check and grammar-assistive devices</li>  </ul>  <p>When in doubt about possible accommodations, ask the employee what would be helpful. In addition, remember to observe confidentiality. For example, avoid pointing out the employee or the alternative arrangements to the rest of the work group.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Eve Woodman Tominey  Matthew Tominey',NULL,102,'Cornell University',NULL,'July, 2001',NULL),(30,'ADA/FMLA','Leave Rights under the FMLA and ADA:  The Intersection of Two Laws Impacting Employee Leave',1,'<h2>Introduction</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The following discussion will provide a basic overview of employee and employer rights involving leave under both the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) and Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The discussion will then focus on the areas where the two laws intersect, providing both overlapping and distinctive protections and obligations.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Overview of ADA Leave Protections</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Title I of the ADA, which is enforced by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportu&shy;nity Commission (EEOC), protects qualified individuals with disabilities from discrimination on the basis of disability.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> Under the ADA, employers are re&shy;quired to provide necessary reasonable accommodations unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. A &ldquo;reasonable accommodation&rdquo; is a change in the workplace that enables an employee to perform the essential func&shy;tions of his/her job.</p>  <p>Leave is one form of reasonable accommodation in that it enables an employee to take time off from work, take care of whatever required the leave, and return to work and to the performance of the job&rsquo;s essential functions. In some cases, leave on a short term, long term, or even hourly basis, will be the only effective accommodation.<a href=\"#2\"><sup>2</sup></a> In other situations, leave may be an effective accommodation, but there may also be other effective accom&shy;modations that will allow the person to stay on the job. Under the ADA, the employer, preferably in conjunction with the individual requesting the accommodation, makes the fi&shy;nal decision regarding which effective reason&shy;able accommodation it will provide.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup> The EEOC&rsquo;s ADA regulations are set forth at 29 C.F.R. Part 1630.</div>  <div id=\"2\"><sup>2</sup> A modification or adjustment satisfies the reasonable accommodation obligation if it is \"effective.\" Leave may be the only effective accommodation where the employee needs time off to obtain medical treatment, recuperate from an illness or an episodic manifestation of a disability, repair a wheelchair or other device, and so forth.</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>Overview of FMLA Requirements</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">In general terms, the FMLA provides leave to certain employees who are experiencing serious health issues or who need to care for a family member. The purpose of the FMLA therefore differs from that of the ADA. While the FMLA provides eligible employees with a benefit that they may exercise when cir&shy;cumstances dictate, the ADA instead seeks to provide equal employment opportunities to employees with disabilities.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Coverage and Eligibility</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">The FMLA allows employees to balance their work and family life by taking, in most cases, up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for certain family and medical reasons. The FMLA applies to all:</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; state, local and federal employers, and lo&shy;cal education agencies (schools), and</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; private sector employers who employ 50 or more employees for at least 20 work&shy;weeks in the current or preceding calendar year, including joint employers and succes&shy;sor employers.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">The U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s Employ&shy;ment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, enforces the FMLA for private, state and local government and some federal employees.<a href=\"#3\"><sup>3</sup></a> Most federal and congressional employees are subject to the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management or Congress.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must work for a covered employer and:</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">1. have worked for that employer for at least 12 months; and</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">2. have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months prior to the start of the FMLA leave; and,</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">3. work at a location where at least 50 employees are employed at the location, or within 75 miles thereof.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">All time worked counts toward the required 12 months of employment. The 1,250 hours requirement can be satisfied in different ways, including regular fulltime work, working 104 hours per month for 12 months, or working 24 hours per week for 52 weeks.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Leave Entitlement</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">A covered employer must grant an eligible employee up to a total of 12 work-weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for any one or more of the following reasons:</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; the birth of a son or daughter, and the care of that newborn child;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; the placement of a child with the employee through adoption or foster care, and the care of that child;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; the care of an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent&mdash;but not a parent &ldquo;in-law&rdquo;) with a serious health condition;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; one&rsquo;s own care, therapy or recuperation when unable to work because of a serious health condition; and</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; the exigencies that arise when a family member who is a member of the regular or reserve components of the Armed Forces is deployed to any foreign country.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">In addition, the FMLA allows 26 weeks of un&shy;paid leave for family members who are veter&shy;ans and need medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness incurred in or aggravated by active duty service.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Leave to care for a newborn child or newly-placed child must conclude within 12 months after birth or placement. Spouses employed by the same employer are jointly entitled to a combined total of 12 workweeks of family leave for the birth or placement of a child and its related care, and to care for an employee&rsquo;s parent who has a serious health condition.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Definition of Serious Health Condition</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">&ldquo;Serious health condition&rdquo; means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental con&shy;dition that involves:</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; any period of incapacity or treatment con&shy;nected with inpatient care (i.e., an over&shy;night stay) in a hospital, hospice, or resi&shy;dential medical care facility;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; a period of incapacity requiring absence of more than three calendar days from work, school, or other regular daily activities that also involves continuing treatment by (or under the supervision of) a health care provider;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; any period of incapacity due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care;</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; any period of incapacity (or treatment therefore) due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.);</p>  <p class=\"Pa6\">&bull; a period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Al&shy;zheimer&rsquo;s, stroke, terminal diseases, etc.); or,</p>  <p>&bull; any absences to receive multiple treat&shy;ments (including related recovery periods) by, or on referral by, a health care provider for a condition that likely would result in incapacity of more than three consecutive days if left untreated (e.g., chemotherapy, physical therapy, dialysis, etc.).</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Intermittent/Reduced Schedule Leave</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">The FMLA permits employees to take leave on an intermittent basis (i.e., from time-to-time) or to work a reduced schedule (e.g., a four-day week or a six-hour day) under certain circum&shy;stances, including to care for a seriously ill family member, or because of the employee&rsquo;s serious health condition. Intermittent/reduced schedule leave may be taken to care for a newborn or newly placed child only with the employer&rsquo;s approval.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Employees needing intermittent/reduced schedule leave for foreseeable medical treat&shy;ment must work with their employers to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the employer&rsquo;s operations, subject to the ap&shy;proval of the employee&rsquo;s health care provider. If the intermittent or reduced schedule leave would unduly disrupt the employer&rsquo;s opera&shy;tions, the employer may instead transfer the employee temporarily to an alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits that better accommodates recurring periods of leave.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Use of Paid Leave</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Employees may choose to use, or employers may require the employee to use, accrued paid leave to cover some or all of the FMLA leave taken. Employees may choose, or employers may require, the substitution of accrued paid vacation or personal leave for any of the situ&shy;ations covered by FMLA. The substitution of accrued sick or family leave is limited by the employer\'s policies governing the use of such leave.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Notification and Certification</span></p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Employees may be required to give 30 days notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. In circumstances in which the need for leave was not foreseeable, the employee should provide notice to the employer as soon as is practicable (generally within one to two days of learning of the need to take leave). An employer may require that a leave request for a serious health condition of the employee or the employee\'s immediate family member be supported by a certifica&shy;tion issued by a health care provider. There is an approved Department of Labor form for this purpose.<a href=\"#4\"><sup>4</sup></a> The employer may not make a broad request for medical records.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Return to Work</span></p>  <p>Upon return from FMLA leave, an employee must be restored to his\\her original job, or to an &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; job, which means virtu&shy;ally identical to the original job in terms of pay, benefits, and other employment terms and conditions. In addition, an employee\'s use of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of any employment benefit that the employee earned or was entitled to before using FMLA leave. Under limited circumstances, however, an employer may refuse to reinstate certain highly-paid, salaried &ldquo;key&rdquo; employees where doing so would cause &ldquo;substantial and griev&shy;ous economic injury&rdquo; to its operations.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"3\"><sup>3</sup> The Department of Labor&rsquo;s FMLA regulations are set forth at 29 C.F.R. Part 825.</div>  <div id=\"4\"><sup>4</sup> This form is available at http://www.dol.gov/asp/ar&not;chive/reports/fmla/APPENDIXF.htm</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>When is There Overlapping Coverage Between the ADA and the FMLA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Private employers with 50 or more employees are covered by both the FMLA and the ADA. State and local government employers are also covered by both the FMLA and the ADA, regardless of the number of employees. Quali&shy;fied individuals with disabilities covered un&shy;der the ADA must also meet the FMLA quali&shy;fication requirements of at least 12 months of total employment and at least 1,250 hours worked in the prior 12 months to be eligible for FMLA leave.</p>  </div>  <h2>Is an FMLA &ldquo;Serious Health Condition&rdquo; the same as an ADA Disability?&rdquo;</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Not necessarily. An ADA disability is an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. Some FMLA serious heath conditions, such as most cancers, heart disease, and serious strokes, likely would also be ADA disabilities. Other conditions, such as pregnancy, an appendectomy, or a routine broken leg, may be serious health conditions, but generally would not meet the ADA defini&shy;tion of disability.</p>  <p>Similarly, a record of a serious health condi&shy;tion may or may not qualify as a record of disability. Likewise, just because the employer knows that someone has a serious health condition does not mean that the employer necessarily regards him/her as having an ADA disability.</p>  </div>  <h2>Are FMLA Certification Inquiries Permissible Under the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Yes. When an employee requests leave un&shy;der the FMLA for a serious health condition, employers will not violate the ADA by asking for information specified in the FMLA certifi&shy;cation form. An employer has a right to know why an employee, who would otherwise be at work, is requesting time off under the FMLA. This type of narrow inquiry would also be job-related and consistent with business necessity under the ADA.</p>  <p>An employer may keep a single medical file that contains both FMLA and ADA informa&shy;tion. Such file must be kept separate from the regular personnel file and meet ADA confiden&shy;tiality standards.</p>  </div>  <h2>General Comparison of ADA and FMLA Leave</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">The FMLA allows for a maximum of 12 workweeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period, except in the case of the 26 workweeks of unpaid leave available to care for veterans. A qualified individual with a disability could be entitled to more than the number of weeks of unpaid leave available under the FMLA as a reasonable accommodation under the ADA, provided that such leave would not impose an undue hardship on the employer&rsquo;s business.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">The FMLA allows leave to be taken intermit&shy;tently or in the form of a reduced work sched&shy;ule (for example, a three-day week instead of a five-day week until the leave is exhausted). The FMLA also allows the employer to require the employee to transfer to an alternative job with equivalent pay and benefits while the leave is being utilized, if necessary.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Under the ADA, an individual with a dis&shy;ability may work part-time or take occasional time off so long as it does not impose an un&shy;due hardship on the employer. If, or when, it does impose an undue hardship, the employer must attempt to reassign the employee to a vacant equivalent position or, as a last resort, to a vacant lower position so that the leave or reduced schedule could be continued. Of course, the employer and employee are always free to agree on a voluntary transfer to a dif&shy;ferent position if both parties deem this prefer&shy;able to accommodating the person in his/her current position.</p>  <p>Keep in mind that an individual with a dis&shy;ability who is using FMLA leave to work reduced hours may also need a reasonable ac&shy;commodation (e.g., special equipment) under the ADA to perform an essential function of the job.</p>  </div>  <h2>When the Employer Wants to Keep the Employee On the Job</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Under the ADA, an employer may offer an employee a reasonable accommodation other than the leave that has been requested, as long as it is effective. For example, an employer may offer special equipment, an opportunity to work reduced hours in the employee&rsquo;s current job, or a temporary assignment to another job in lieu of leave, if these are effective accom&shy;modations.</p>  <p>However, if the individual is eligible for FMLA leave and has a serious health condition that prevents him/her from performing an essen&shy;tial job function, s/he has the right to take that leave, even if s/he could continue working with a reasonable accommodation. While the FMLA does not prevent an employee from ac&shy;cepting an alternative to leave, the acceptance must be voluntary and uncoerced.</p>  </div>  <h2>Return to Work</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Under the ADA, the employee is entitled to return to the same job unless the employer demonstrates that holding the job open would impose an undue hardship. In this situation, reassignment to another position would have to be considered as discussed above. Reas&shy;signment would also need to be attempted if the person upon returning to work is no lon&shy;ger able to perform the essential functions of his/her original position even with reasonable accommodations.</p>  <p>Under the FMLA, the individual may be re&shy;turned to the same or an equivalent position, which means a position that is virtually identi&shy;cal in terms of pay, benefits, and other employ&shy;ment terms and conditions. If an employee cannot perform the essential functions of this job or the equivalent position, the FMLA does not require reassignment to another job.</p>  </div>  <h2>Insurance Coverage</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Under the ADA, the employer must continue health insurance coverage for an employee taking leave or working part-time only if the employer also provides coverage for other employees in the same leave or part-time status. Under the FMLA, an employer always must maintain the employee&rsquo;s existing level of coverage under a group health plan during the FMLA leave, provided the employee pays his/her share of the premiums. Other benefits, such as life or disability insurance, must also be provided to the person taking FMLA leave if the benefits are provided to others in the same leave or part-time status.</p>  </div>  <h2>Complying with both the FMLA and the ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">If an employee requests time off for a reason related or possibly related to disability (for example, a request for six weeks off to get treatment for a back problem), the employer should consider this a request for ADA reason&shy;able accommodation as well as FMLA leave. However, if the employee makes it clear that they only want FMLA leave, the employer should not make additional inquiries related to ADA coverage.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">When both the ADA and the FMLA apply to an employee&rsquo;s medical leave, the FMLA rule provides that an employer must provide the employee with the greatest rights available under either statute.</p>  <p>Example: A qualified individual with a dis&shy;ability who is also an &ldquo;eligible employee&rdquo; entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 weeks of medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which the employer grants because it is not an undue hardship. The employer advises the employee that the 10 weeks of leave is also be&shy;ing designated as FMLA leave and will count towards the employee\'s FMLA leave entitle&shy;ment. This designation does not prevent the parties from also treating the leave as a reason&shy;able accommodation. The employer should reinstate the employee into the same job upon his or her return to work because this right, available under the ADA, is greater than that promised under the FMLA. At the same time, the FMLA requires the employer to maintain group health plan coverage during the leave, and that requirement is the greater right avail&shy;able to the employee.</p>  </div>  <h2>Family Leave</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The FMLA requires an employer to grant leave for the employee to care for his/her spouse, child, or parent with a serious health condi&shy;tion. By contrast, the ADA&rsquo;s reasonable ac&shy;commodation requirement does not extend to granting time off to care for a family member with a disability. Of course, when an employ&shy;er opts to offer family leave as an employee benefit, the employer must provide the leave in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>  </div>  <h2>FMLA Information or Complaints</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">For additional information about the FMLA or to file an FMLA complaint, individuals should contact the nearest office of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division is listed in most telephone directories under U.S. Government, U.S. Department of Labor.

The symptoms are often subjective, and other problems or stressors (including heat stress) may aggravate the prob&shy;lem. Some individuals may be particularly sensitive. Since people exposed to poor indoor air quality frequently experience subjective symptoms, they are of&shy;ten viewed as over-emotional or simply complainers &ndash; so it is important to place this problem on a scientific basis so as to be able to take a more constructive, problem solving approach.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is Poor Indoor Air Quality?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Science has shown that the quality of air with&shy;in buildings is, at times, worse than the quality of outdoor air. Indoor air quality problems, believed to be related to contaminants concen&shy;trated within buildings, can cause symptoms and illnesses among people who spend time therein. When one considers the number of workers in offices, banks, school buildings, restaurants, hotels, hospitals, and health care institutions in the United States, it is not sur&shy;prising to learn that indoor air quality impacts the health and productivity of the majority of working adults and the vast majority of work&shy;ing women. Moreover, when one includes time at home as well as at work, people spend approximately 90 percent of their time in&shy;doors.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Are The Causes Of Poor Indoor Air Quality?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <ul>  <li>inadequate fresh air supply and/or poor ventilation system maintenance</li>  <li>pollutants given off by building or furnish&shy;ing materials</li>  <li>pollutants from processes occurring within the building, including cleaning products, office machines, pesticides, and off gases from new materials</li>  <li>microorganisms or other biological con&shy;taminants, or,</li>  <li>contaminants brought into the building from outside; some examples are exhausts from sanitary stacks, boiler stacks, natural gas vents, or flues.</li>  </ul>  <p>When building ventilation is inadequate, the resulting low air exchange rate is such that there is insufficient fresh air brought into the building to dilute or flush out contaminants and they can become concentrated within the building. Improving indoor air quality does not mean that the indoor air must become pristine and pure, but rather that building oc&shy;cupants should not be subjected to air quality that is significantly worse than the air outside, especially if the occupant does not experience his/her health problem when exposed to out&shy;side air (and so long as the outside air is rea&shy;sonably acceptable by USEPA or other health standards).</p>  </div>  <h2>What Can You Do To Correct Poor Indoor Air Quality Problems?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>If ventilation is inadequate, increase the fresh air supply to meet the recommendations of Standard 62.1 2007 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). ASHRAE recommen&shy;dations are well-respected industry standards and often incorporated into building codes and other regulations. This industry standard recommends ventilation needs in terms of the amount of cubic feet per minute per person of fresh air for rooms and buildings depending upon their usage. For office space, it recom&shy;mends 5 cfm/person of outdoor air. Check to make sure that the air intakes and exhausts for each room are functioning. For some spaces, ASHRAE recommends minimum exhaust rates, as well. Ventilation adequacy can be verified by measuring the air concentration of carbon dioxide during occupancy.</p>  <p>If indoor sources are the problem, choose al&shy;ternative products or eliminate the use of trou&shy;blesome products. Schedule product usage or construction/remodeling for times when it will have the least impact on occupants; con&shy;sider changing schedules or using flextime or time off for sensitive individuals such as those who are pregnant, those with allergies or those who have respiratory, cardiovascu&shy;lar, or other problems that the exposure could adversely affect. Provide better ventilation or local exhaust ventilation for specific contami&shy;nant sources. Ban smoking in the building or provide a smoking lounge with smoke vented to the outside away from any air intakes. Your state, county, or municipality may have smok&shy;ing prohibitions for your building or work&shy;place. Purchase new materials or furnishings with low emissions (often these are &ldquo;green&rdquo; alternatives). New materials and furnishings could also be purchased in advance and stored where they can be allowed to offgas before being installed in their new locations. Con&shy;sider increased ventilation or &ldquo;baking off&rdquo; for new materials or remodeled areas to speed up the offgassing process. Baking-off involves heating the room, wing, or building (as ap&shy;propriate) to about 80-85 Fahrenheit for about 12 hours. The air temperature is decreased as low as possible for the next 12 hours while the room is ventilated. This process of heating and cooling can be repeated several times.</p>  <p>If outside sources are the problem, separate air intakes from exhausts or raise exhausts higher to prevent exhaust air from being drawn back inside. ASHRAE 62.1-2007 makes recommen&shy;dations for minimum separation distances &ndash; see if your building meets these. Prevent ve&shy;hicles from idling for long periods of time near air intakes; some states or cities have health or environmental regulations which forbid idling. Separate a garage&rsquo;s part of the ventila&shy;tion system from that servicing the rest of the building. Verify air pressure in the building relative to the outside; a building that is under negative pressure could cause drains, sanitary stacks, or exhaust vents to run backwards.</p>  <p>If biological contamination is the problem, make sure there is adequate cleaning and maintenance of air intakes, filters, and duct&shy;work. Fix leaks, condensation, and standing water in the building or the ventilation system. Send the condensation from coils or air con&shy;ditioners to a drain. Discard water damaged items and those with porous surfaces. Disin&shy;fect nonporous materials.</p>  <p>If building fabric is the problem, baking-off may help. Check insulation to verify its prop&shy;er installation, and conduct air monitoring.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Do You Find Out If Your Building Has An Indoor Air Quality Problem?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Gather information from building occupants. When investigating complaints of indoor air quality, it is important to determine the nature of the complaints and extent of the problem. This can be accomplished by surveying the people who work, live in, and visit the build&shy;ing. When collecting information:</p>  <ul>  <li>review the records of complaints; if there are no existing records, create a complaint log</li>  <li>interview the occupants, either directly, by the use of a questionnaire, or both (obtain&shy;ing medical advice and/or actual diagno&shy;ses of health conditions would be ideal), if possible and with the necessary privacy protection; however, the typically subjec&shy;tive nature of IAQ symptoms may make occupants&rsquo; reports the only information available</li>  <li>avoid asking questions that might be un&shy;necessarily intrusive (for example, health or medical questions concerning reproduc&shy;tive history or psychological problems)</li>  <li>ask occupants to document their observa&shy;tions in an occupant diary so as to observe trends or intermittent problems</li>  </ul>  <p>Check out the ventilation system. Find out if there is enough fresh air being brought into the building. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) 62.1-2007 recommends that office spaces have 5 cubic feet per min&shy;ute (cfm) per person of outdoor air provided.</p>  <p>There are similar recommendations for schools and other building types and usages. Verify this with carbon dioxide measurements dur&shy;ing times of occupancy; the CO2 level inside the building is usually higher than that out&shy;side the building since people exhale CO2. This makes CO2 a useful surrogate measure of air turnover. Outside there is about 300-500 ppm of carbon dioxide (this is the composition of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere). Inside, the carbon di&shy;oxide should be no more than 700 ppm higher than the outside air concentration.</p>  <p>Examine the intakes and exhausts for con&shy;tamination and cross contamination; verify this with carbon monoxide or other measure&shy;ments as appropriate. For any monitoring performed, measure the same items in the outdoor air for comparison purposes. Be care&shy;ful in the choice of method used so as to obtain a low enough detection limit as to be able to compare indoor air with outdoor air. Check out the heating, ventilation, and air condition&shy;ing system\'s performance and maintenance. Walk through the building and look for signs of leaks and water damage. Check the chemi&shy;cal usage in the building and look for potential sources of air contaminants. Make any correc&shy;tions necessary as a result of these examina&shy;tions and then re-survey the building inhabit&shy;ants to see if conditions have improved and if any problems remain.</p>  <p>Usually these steps are enough, but sometimes further monitoring is needed. If the correc&shy;tions to ventilation or contaminant sources do not fix the problem or if the ventilation system was adequate, it may become necessary to proceed further to better identify the specific contaminants and their possible sources, such as: microbial monitoring (with identification of the bacteria and molds), measurement of par&shy;ticulates (with identification of particles and fibers), or chemical analysis for air contami&shy;nants (such as formaldehyde, ozone, pesti&shy;cides, or volatile solvents). And, as above, take outdoor measurements as well and compare indoor air with outdoor air. Keep in mind that, as IAQ involves non-industrial workplaces, it is rare to find that the concentration of air con&shy;taminants violates OSHA regulations or other groups&rsquo; recommendations intended to address the industrial environment.</p>  <p>Consider whether the expense of this ad&shy;ditional monitoring is justified; it may be far more cost effective to remove the contaminant source than to pay for the testing. Consider whether these additional data will make a difference in the decision to fix or not to fix a potential problem. If you are going to fix it anyway, are the data needed to confirm that exposure happened or are the data a waste of the funds which could be used to fix the prob&shy;lem?</p>  <p>Keep building occupants informed. Building occupants should be kept informed during the entire process of investigation and mitigation, including:</p>  <ul>  <li>how the investigation is progressing, the types of information being gathered, and ways that they can help the process along</li>  <li>the nature of the health problems being re&shy;ported; this enables occupants to put their symptoms into perspective</li>  <li>how long the investigation is expected to last</li>  <li>any attempts that are made to improve indoor air quality</li>  <li>any remaining work that needs to be done and the schedule for its completion.</li>  </ul>  <p>If the above-described investigation indicates that an indoor quality problem exists, consult with a qualified expert who can make ap&shy;propriate recommendations for remediation. Such an expert could include an industrial hygienist, a ventilation engineer with IAQ ex&shy;perience, a HVAC contractor with IAQ experi&shy;ence, a safety risk manager with IAQ experi&shy;ence, or other similarly qualified consultant.</p>  </div>  <h2>Reasonable Accommodation Under The ADA For Someone Who Needs Better Air Quality (Even After Corrections Are Done)</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>In striving to make the indoor environment not significantly different from the outdoor environment, the building air quality may reach the limit of what is feasible for a whole building performance approach. Despite the best efforts to improve ventilation and remove sources of contaminants, you may discover that the individuals who meet the definition of disability under the ADA due to, for example, very sensitive allergies, a suppressed immune system, or an environmental illness still re&shy;quire some form of reasonable accommoda&shy;tion to be able to perform their job.</p>  <p>The ADA defines an individual with a disabili&shy;ty as someone with a physical or mental im&shy;pairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Major life activities include actions such as caring for oneself, walking, talking, seeing, breathing, and working. In determin&shy;ing whether an impairment is substantially limiting, ameliorative measures such as medi&shy;cations are not considered. In other words, an employee who successfully controls the adverse effects of exposure to poor air quality through the use of medications could never&shy;theless qualify as disabled if the effects of that exposure in their unmitigated state substan&shy;tially limit his or her breathing or other major life activity.</p>  <p>A reasonable accommodation is a modifica&shy;tion or adjustment to a job, the work environ&shy;ment, or the way things usually are done that enables a qualified individual with a disability to enjoy an equal employment opportunity. Employers are not required to provide any accommodation if it would impose an undue hardship upon that employer&rsquo;s business.</p>  <p>This determination of what constitutes an undue burden can vary from one employer to the next, depending upon the size of the em&shy;ployer&rsquo;s business, its financial resources and other factors.</p>  <p>The following are some options that courts may consider reasonable:</p>  <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider removing from a room any chem&shy;ical challenges by stripping the room of any items that could be a problem, such as carpeting or pressed wood products, and provide a plain floor, a metal desk, mini&shy;mal use of solvent based products, no air fresheners, no pesticides, no fragrances, etc.</p>  <p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider the use of a room-sized air clean&shy;ing unit having a carbon filter and high efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) capable of removing the problem contami&shy;nants. Be sure the unit is large enough to handle the air volume needs for the size of the room.</p>  <p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider moving the person to a differ&shy;ent work environment such as a different room, wing, or building that has not had recent remodeling or that uses a different HVAC system.</p>  </div>','http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/edicollect/1295',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,1,'Nellie J.

Sometimes the interaction of different legal requirements can be confusing. In a random sample survey of the membership of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) conducted in 1998 by Cornell University,<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> respondents indicated that they were frequently or occa&shy;sionally uncertain of selected areas where the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) intersect. For example, approximately one-half of the respondents expressed uncertainty about whether OSHA regulations supersede the confidentiality requirements of the ADA. Other areas of uncertainty included whether worksite modifications or ergonomic changes constitute reasonable accommodation (46% of respondents), and whether it is permissible to discipline an employee who is a risk to self or others (40%).</p>  <p>The following discussion will provide an over&shy;view of the employment sections of the ADA, the requirements of the OSH Act, a discussion of key areas where these laws intersect, and resources for future reference. Staying current on agency guidance and emerging case law in these areas will further assist the HR profes&shy;sional in helping businesses resolve questions involving workplace safety and the rights of employees with disabilities.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup> An Executive Summary of this report is available from the Cornell University web site /www. ilr.cornell.edu/edi</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>What does Title I of the ADA require?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Title I of the ADA protects individuals with disabilities from employment discrimination on the basis of disability. The U.S. Equal Em&shy;ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces Title I protections, which apply to the entire employment relationship, including the application process, hiring, training, promo&shy;tion, termination, compensation, and other benefits and privileges of employment, such as health and retirement benefits and employer-sponsored social functions.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The ADA requires employers to provide nec&shy;essary reasonable accommodations for quali&shy;fied individuals with disabilities. Potential reasonable accommodations include making existing facilities accessible, restructuring jobs, allowing part-time or modified work sched&shy;ules, providing assistive technology, provid&shy;ing aides or qualified interpreters, modifying tests or policies, and reassigning the qualified individual to a vacant position. Generally, the individual with a disability must inform the employer that an accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>The employer should confer with the employ&shy;ee about what accommodations would enable him/her to perform the essential functions of the position. When no accommodation is readily identified or when alternative options are desired, technical assistance may be help&shy;ful in determining how to accommodate an employee in a specific situation. If the indi&shy;vidual cannot perform an essential function of the job, even with accommodation, then that individual is not considered \"a qualified indi&shy;vidual with a disability\" under the law and is not protected by the ADA. Furthermore, even if the employee is qualified, he or she will not be protected by the ADA if accommodating him or her would impose an \"undue hardship\" on the employer&rsquo;s business. This would also assume that the employer has considered the accommodation of job reassignment but that this approach does not remedy the situation.</p>  </div>  <h2>What does the Occupational Safety and Health Act require?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">The Occupational Safety and Health Adminis&shy;tration&rsquo;s (OSHA) mission is to prevent work-related injuries, illnesses and deaths. Since the agency was created in 1971, occupational deaths have been cut in half and injuries have declined by 40 percent. Congress created OSHA under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act), signed into law on De&shy;cember 29, 1970.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">The OSH Act is based on the premise that every worker has a right to a workplace that is free from recognized hazards. When a po&shy;tential hazard is identified, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which is part of the U.S. Department of Labor, develops a standard against which workplace practices or conditions should be measured. Unlike some other employment regulations, OSHA requirements are applied universally to all employers, regardless of the volume of business they conduct or the number of people in their employ.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">After the implementation of a standard, the Labor Department can determine which work&shy;places will be inspected, either by the request of an employee in the particular workplace or at OSHA&rsquo;s discretion. Inspections are con&shy;ducted with the permission of the employer and in accordance with OSHA guidelines. Violations of a standard are punishable by government-ordered abatement and monetary fines, set according to the size of the business, the seriousness of the violation, the good faith of the employer, and the record of prior viola&shy;tions. Violations that result in the death of an employee are punishable under criminal law.<a href=\"#2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p>  <p>Some of the requirements of the OSH Act overlap with provisions of the ADA. The HR professional is likely to encounter questions about the intersection of these laws in the ar&shy;eas of employee testing and screening, confi&shy;dentiality of medical records, and reasonable accommodation.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"2\"><sup>2</sup> 29 U.S.C. Section 666(e).</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>How do the ADA and OSH Act requirements intersect in the area of employment testing and screening?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa4\">Although some employers may wish to use pre-employment physical fitness tests and other exams in order to screen out applicants prone to ergonomic hazard injuries, the ADA limits such testing in order to further its goal of preventing discrimination on the basis of disability. Thus, the ADA requires that when&shy;ever an employer screens out an individual with a disability based upon a test or other qualification standard, the employer must show that: (1) the test or standard is job-re&shy;lated and consistent with business necessity, and (2) the individual with a disability cannot meet such standard by means of reasonable accommodation. In most instances, a risk of future injury won&rsquo;t satisfy this ADA standard. The ADA also prohibits employers from mak&shy;ing medical inquiries or requiring physicals before a job offer is made, and places restric&shy;tions on post-offer, pre-employment inquiries and exams.<a href=\"#3\"><sup>3</sup></a> After the applicant becomes an employee, any medical inquiries and examina&shy;tions must be job-related and consistent with business necessity.</p>  <p>The OSH Act, in contrast, affirmatively re&shy;quires employers to monitor and test employ&shy;ees in a variety of situations to assure safety. For example, employees exposed to high noise levels must be included within an audiometric testing program, which includes among other things, annual hearing tests.<a href=\"#4\"><sup>4</sup></a> The ADA&rsquo;s lim&shy;its on employee and applicant testing might initially appear to conflict with OSHA&rsquo;s need for testing in furtherance of workplace safety goals. However, the ADA regulations recog&shy;nize that if an employer&rsquo;s alleged discrimina&shy;tory action was taken in order to comply with another federal law or regulation, the employ&shy;er may assert this as a defense to a charge of discrimination. An applicant or employee can thereafter rebut such defense by showing that compliance with other federal law is simply a pretext for discrimination or that the employer could have complied with the federal standard in a non-discriminatory way.<a href=\"#5\"><sup>5</sup></a> HR profession&shy;als should assist in resolving any potential conflicts between the requirements of the ADA and the OSH Act by determining whether the employer can meet the requirements of both laws or whether the ADA&rsquo;s conflicting federal law defense is applicable.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"3\"><sup>3</sup> More information on ADA rules and regulations governing employment testing, screening and medical exams can be found in other brochures in this series entitled &ldquo;Pre-Employment Testing and the ADA,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pre- Employment Screening Considerations and the ADA,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Employee Medical Exams and Disability-Related Inquiries under the ADA: Guidance for Employers Regarding Current Employees.&rdquo;  <div id=\"4\"><sup>4</sup> See 29 C.F.R. Section 1910.95.</div>  <div id=\"5\"><sup>5</sup> 29 C.F.R. Section 1630.15(e).</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>What are the considerations in complying with the ADA&rsquo;s confidentiality requirements regarding medical records and the OSH Act&rsquo;s recordkeeping requirements relating to occupational illness and injury?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa4\">The ADA requires strict confidentiality of medical records. All information obtained from post-offer medical exams and inquiries must be collected and maintained on sepa&shy;rate forms, in separate medical files and must be treated as a confidential medical record. Employers must take steps to guarantee the security of employee medical information, in&shy;cluding keeping the information in a medical file in a locked cabinet apart from the location of regular personal files. Employers should also designate a specific person or persons who will have access to the medical files. The ADA provides, however, that employers may disclose the records when necessary to: (1) supervisors and managers in regard to work restrictions or necessary accommodations, (2) first aid and safety personnel, (3) government officials investigating the ADA and other dis&shy;ability discrimination laws, (4) state workers&rsquo; compensation offices, and (5) insurance com&shy;panies that require a medical exam to provide employees with health or life insurance.</p>  <p>The OSH Act requires employers to keep re&shy;cords of workplace injuries and illnesses and grants OSHA personnel access to such records in the interest of exposing potential hazards and their causes.<a href=\"#6\"><sup>6</sup></a> About 1.3 million employ&shy;ers with 11 or more employees &ndash; 20 percent of the establishments that OSHA covers &ndash; must keep records of work-related injuries and ill&shy;nesses. Workplaces in low-hazard industries such as retail, service, finance, insurance and real estate are exempt from record-keeping requirements.</p>  <p class=\"Pa4\">The OSH Act requires that employers subject to recordkeeping requirements and OSHA compliance personnel who enforce record&shy;keeping requirements maintain the confiden&shy;tiality of medical records. OSHA Forms 300 and 301, which employers must use to report recordable illnesses and injuries, note that employers who use the employee health infor&shy;mation contained in those forms for occupa&shy;tional safety and health purposes must protect employee confidentiality to the fullest extent possible. Likewise, OSHA compliance personnel, who have the authority to examine medi&shy;cal records to verify employer recordkeeping compliance, must perform such examinations on-site and are prohibited from recording and/ or taking off-site any information contained within those records. In addition, OSHA personnel will exercise their authority to gain access to personally identifiable employee medical information only after the agency has made a careful determination of its need for this information, and only with appropriate safeguards to protect individual privacy.<a href=\"#7\"><sup>7</sup></a></p>  <p>Overall, the OSHA regulations appear to be concerned about the confidentiality of em&shy;ployee medical information in a manner that is generally consistent with the ADA&rsquo;s confiden&shy;tiality requirements. HR personnel should guide employers to construe OSHA require&shy;ments in a manner that also complies with the ADA&rsquo;s confidentiality provisions whenever possible. Clearly, however, OSHA personnel and other individuals designated in the OSHA regulations, including representatives from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), will insist upon access to those medical records they deem vital to their mission.<a href=\"#8\"><sup>8</sup></a> While these parties are not listed in the ADA as having access to confidential medical records, the ADA&rsquo;s conflicting federal law and regulation defense would protect an employer who grants access to OSHA repre&shy;sentatives acting pursuant to federal law.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"6\"><sup>6</sup> 29 C.F.R. Section 1904.</div>  <div id=\"7\"><sup>7</sup> 29 C.F.R. Section 1913.</div>  <div id=\"8\"><sup>8</sup> 29 C.F.R. Section 1904.40.</div>  </div>  </div>  <h2>How does the ADA&rsquo;s reasonable accommodation requirement interact with the OSH Act?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa4\">The ADA requires that employers consider reasonably accommodating any employee with a disability so that he or she can perform the essential functions of the job, in accordance with OSH Act requirements. For example, if an audiometric test required by OSHA iden&shy;tifies that an employee has a hearing loss because of exposure to loud equipment, the employer might be tempted to terminate the employee or transfer him or her to another job to prevent continued exposure. The ADA requires, however, that the employer first consider an accommodation (such as sound abatement equipment) that would enable the employee to remain in his or her current posi&shy;tion. If no such accommodation would work, the employer may then consider reassigning the employee.</p>  <p>OSHA regulations may prohibit certain ac&shy;commodations. For instance, OSHA&rsquo;s respira&shy;tor requirements are clear and specific. Where OSHA regulations require employees to wear respirators on a particular job, an employer would not have to keep an employee who is unable to wear a respirator in a position that requires one as part of a reasonable accom&shy;modation. The ADA would require, however, that the employer consider transferring this employee to an equivalent, vacant position as an alternate accommodation.</p>  </div>  <h2>What other experts can help the HR professional dealing with OSHA and ADA requirements?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa3\">Larger employers may employ their own spe&shy;cialists to assist with health and safety consid&shy;erations and accommodation issues, including health and safety specialists, ergonomists, occupational health specialists, physical thera&shy;pists, and occupational therapists. Smaller employers may hire these services as needed from outside agencies. Knowing which pro&shy;fessionals to call is often the first important step for HR professionals, who will often be assisting supervisors in dealing with these issues. The HR professional will work closely with these service providers in applying and utilizing their advice within the framework of ADA and OSHA requirements.<a href=\"#9\"><sup>9</sup></a></p>  <p class=\"Pa4\">For example, orthopedic or musculoskeletal injury, specifically back injury, is the type of disability that has the highest number of claims before the EEOC for alleged disability discrimination under the ADA (approximately 17% of total claims as of FY 2008). HR profes&shy;sionals will often encounter accommodation and health and safety questions about persons with musculoskeletal injuries. Supervisors or HR professionals may want to seek the assis&shy;tance of an ergonomist, physical or occupa&shy;tional therapist, industrial hygienist, or health and safety specialist. Ergonomists integrate knowledge derived from the human sciences to match jobs, systems, products, and environ&shy;ments to the physical and mental abilities and limitations of people.<a href=\"#10\"><sup>10</sup></a></p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">An ergonomist uses information about people, for example their size, ability to handle infor&shy;mation and make decisions, ability to see and hear, and ability to work in extreme tem&shy;peratures, to match people to jobs.<a href=\"#11\"><sup>11</sup></a> Physical therapists, or PTs, are health care profession&shy;als who evaluate and treat people with health problems resulting from injury or disease. PTs assess joint motion, muscle strength and endurance, function of heart and lungs, and performance of activities required in daily liv&shy;ing.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Occupational therapists (OTs) evaluate and treat individuals with injuries, illnesses, cogni&shy;tive impairments, psychosocial dysfunctions, mental illness, developmental learning disabil&shy;ities, physical disabilities, or other disorders or conditions. Evaluation and intervention by an OT focuses on an individual&rsquo;s level of function and involves assessment of performance com&shy;ponents, and performance context.</p>  <p class=\"Pa4\">An industrial hygienist plays a role in insuring that the workplace is as free as possible from hazards and that the workers in the communi&shy;ty at large are protected from potential health threats. Some of the areas that industrial hygienists may get involved in include: testing for and possibly removing toxic materials in the work environment; helping to limit dis&shy;abilities caused by repetitive and/prolonged movement, such as typing at a keyboard, or sitting at a desk all day; and setting limits on exposure levels and providing guidelines for control of chemicals, noise, and radiation in the workplace.</p>  <p class=\"Pa3\">Further information about the services pro&shy;vided by and the credentials of these profes&shy;sionals may be gained from the relevant pro&shy;fessional associations, listed in the \"Resources\" section of this brochure.</p>  <p>The HR professional is also likely to get many questions about mental health disabilities. Employers often express concern that people with certain psychiatric disabilities or a history of treatment may pose a safety concern. Ac&shy;cording to the National Mental Health Associ&shy;ation, \"Violent acts committed by persons with mental illness represent a small fraction of the violence perpetrated in our country, yet these acts are frequently highly sensationalized by the media and lead to the continued stigmati&shy;zation of persons with mental illness.\" <a href=\"#12\"><sup>12</sup></a> Get&shy;ting more information about mental health or psychiatric disabilities in general, and consul&shy;tation on the unique accommodation consid&shy;erations for a particular individual, is impera&shy;tive when there are questions surrounding a mental health disability.<a href=\"#13\"><sup>13</sup></a> A mental health professional or employee assistance program (EAP) professional may be of assistance in this situation.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"9\"><sup>9</sup> See \"Workplace Accommodations for Persons with Musculoskeletal Injuries,\" in this brochure series, for more information.</div>  <div id=\"10\"><sup>10</sup> For further information, contact the Human Factors in Ergonomics Society (see Resources).</div>  <div id=\"11\"><sup>11</sup> Congress and the President took action in 2000 to rescind the major ergonomics rule that DOL had published at the end of 1999.

Be&shy;cause the ADA covers all aspects of participation in society, such as employment, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications, its impact is felt in business organizations in multiple ways. Businesses are covered by the ADA both as employers and as providers of goods and services. It is therefore important that each business organization equip its employees for compliance with the ADA by providing appropriate information and personnel training on the ADA&rsquo;s requirements, its relevance to the functioning of the organization as a whole, and the responsibilities of specific personnel.</p>  </div>  <h2>Which personnel in our organization should receive ADA training?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>&nbsp;The impact of the ADA is broad. Everyone in your organization would find information and training on the ADA relevant to their jobs. General information could be useful to all employees, informing them of their rights and obligations under the ADA.</p>  <p>In the fall of 1998, the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) partnered with Cornell University to conduct a survey of SHRM members.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a> The purpose of this survey was to assess the ADA&rsquo;s impact on HR practice since implementation, and one of the items studied was training conducted on the ADA. The survey asked respondents if their organizations&rsquo; employees had been trained in a number of ADA-related topics, including: non-discriminatory recruitment and hiring, the accommodation process, equal access in promotional opportunities and training, ac&shy;commodation for mental health problems, defining essential job functions, confidenti&shy;ality requirements of medical information, limitations and exclusions the ADA and other federal laws allow health plans to impose, non-discrimination in the disciplinary process or termination, conflict resolution in the ac&shy;commodation process, disability awareness or sensitivity training, and interaction with other state and federal legislation. In nearly all of the areas, more than half of the respondents (813 SHRM members were interviewed) indi&shy;cated their employees received training.</p>  <p>Employers should consider the best way to train their personnel so that they may benefit from ADA training both to ensure that their actions are in compliance with the ADA, and that they are properly responsive to persons with disabilities. Although all employees should receive some training, there are catego&shy;ries of personnel that should be considered for specialized training. These include: training or staff development personnel; human resource development professionals; top management; middle managers; front line supervisors; line employees; union leadership and field repre&shy;sentatives; benefits and compensation staff; safety and environmental health personnel; recruitment and job interviewing personnel; industrial/organizational psychologists or oth&shy;er personnel doing pre-employment screening; organizational development personnel; ergo&shy;nomic specialists; short and long-term disabil&shy;ity managers; technology personnel; customer relations representatives; and receptionists and others who interact with the public.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup> Cornell University received funding for this research from the US Department of Education National Insti-tute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (NIDRR) as a Research and Demonstration Project (Grant No. H133A70005); and it worked with the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the Washington Business Group on Health (WBGH), and the Lewin Group. An Executive Summary is available on-line from Cornell University at http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/edi/</div>  </div>  <h2>Which kinds of ADA information should be shared with these personnel?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>All of your employees would benefit from some basic knowledge about the existence of the ADA and its requirements. More specific information should be directly relevant to the functioning of personnel in the job categories listed above, whose responsibilities might be impacted by the requirements of a particular provision of the ADA. The following are some examples of personnel training that can be considered and targeted to meet the unique information needs of personnel, dependent upon their job functioning:</p>  <ul>  <li>Overall knowledge of all titles of the ADA</li>  <li>Knowledge specific to the ADA employ&shy;ment provisions</li>  <li>Knowledge specific to the ADA public ac&shy;commodations provisions</li>  <li>Employment pre-screening and applicant interviewing under the ADA</li>  <li>Medical, drug, and other testing under the ADA</li>  <li>Relationship between the ADA and other state and federal employment and non-discrimination legislation</li>  <li>Identifying essential job functions</li>  <li>Writing job descriptions that identify es&shy;sential job functions</li>  <li>The reasonable accommodation process</li>  <li>General information regarding specific dis&shy;abilities and possible accommodations</li>  <li>Job evaluation and compensation informa&shy;tion for persons with disabilities</li>  <li>Career equity/promotional considerations for persons with disabilities</li>  <li>Re-skilling when disability occurs</li>  <li>Non-discriminatory performance apprais&shy;als</li>  <li>Impact of the ADA on accommodation requirements in personnel training</li>  <li>Accessibility of information technology in the workplace</li>  <li>Data/record keeping on accommodations</li>  <li>Negotiation/conflict management in the reasonable accommodation process</li>  <li>The place of job coaching and/or support&shy;ive employment in the reasonable accom&shy;modation process</li>  <li>Customer relations with customers with disabilities</li>  </ul>  <p>In training, selected topics, such as specific accommodations for persons with particular disabilities, may be best presented by cou&shy;pling the information of an instructor familiar with the ADA with that of a professional with expertise on accommodation for such persons. Some examples of these professionals include ergonomists, physical or occupational thera&shy;pists, rehabilitation counselors, supported employment specialists, mental health or drug and alcohol abuse therapist/counselors, or rehabilitation engineers.</p>  <p>Other topics that may not directly relate to the requirements of the ADA, but may support the intent of the ADA are training in such topics as: attitudes toward persons with a disability; disability as a facet of diversity; effective dis&shy;ability management; prevention of disability through workplace safety; and effective re&shy;cruitment of persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>The above list is not exhaustive, but repre&shy;sentative of many content areas that can be considered for effective information sharing and staff development on the provisions of the ADA. Specific content should be targeted toward the job responsibilities of personnel receiving the training. The nature of the work itself and the kinds of work-related illnesses and disabilities that occur more often for a particular employer may determine the focus provided on accommodations for particular types of disabling conditions.</p>  </div>  <h2>Where is a good place to start a training effort on the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>As previously mentioned, personnel at all levels of an organization would benefit from ADA information and training. Respondents to the SHRM/Cornell survey indicated that top management commitment to training and nondiscrimination is the number one way to effectively reduce barriers in the employment and advancement of people with disabilities. It is important that any dissemination initia&shy;tive on disability nondiscrimination and diver&shy;sity be seen as a company-wide commitment for a real impact to occur.</p>  <p>In larger companies, where human resource professionals are chiefly responsible for em&shy;ployee recruitment, interviewing, pre-employ&shy;ment screening, benefits, compensation, and training, the human resources department may be the appropriate place to focus initial information dissemination and training ef&shy;forts. It would also be useful to include em&shy;ployee and labor relations personnel in this round of training.</p>  <p>Manager training should come next in larger companies (and perhaps would be first in smaller companies). Some of the topics on the ADA employment provisions, which can be targeted to the information needs of supervi&shy;sors, are as follows: pre-employment screening and ADA requirements; medical, drug, and other testing; writing job descriptions with es&shy;sential job functions; the reasonable accommo&shy;dation process; performance expectations and the person with a disability; and equal access for persons with disabilities to staff develop&shy;ment and promotional opportunities.</p>  </div>  <h2>What are factors to consider for accessibility of training to persons with disabilities?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>The employment provisions of the ADA provide that no employer shall discriminate against an individual with a disability in regard to job training. This means that per&shy;sonnel trainers, to meet the accommodation needs of a trainee with a disability, would be required to provide a reasonable accommo&shy;dation absent undue hardship. Examples of possible modifications include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Restructuring or simplifying training for mats to accommodate trainees with cognitive impairments</li>  <li>Making training rooms wheelchair accessible</li>  <li>Brailling or audio taping print materials</li>  <li>Providing a sign language interpreter or reader</li>  <li>Captioning videotape materials</li>  <li>Being aware of environmental irritants for chemically sensitive trainees</li>  <li>Advocating on behalf of a trainee for training held elsewhere, when an accommodations needed for that individual</li>  </ul>  <p>Trainers also might consider use of informa&shy;tion technologies and other distance learning approaches, which are increasingly being used for personnel training. This can be a real asset for enhanced easy and cost-effective access to training, allowing the user to access the class&shy;room from his/her own office or home. How&shy;ever, the transformation of the Internet from a text-based medium to a robust multi-media environment has created a growing digital divide in access for people with disabilities. Previously, people with visual impairments were able to read web pages with the help of audible screen readers. Today, graphical web pages are a barrier if they do not incorporate accessible web design. The barrier created by inaccessible web pages is not limited to people with visual and mobility disabilities, but ap&shy;plies also to persons with learning or cognitive disabilities. Similarly, persons with hearing impairments cannot access audio or video streaming contents unless they are captioned.<a href=\"#1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>  <p>Designing accessible on-line training can be beneficial to more than just employees with disabilities; many other employees will also find it more user-friendly. Some &ldquo;do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts&rdquo; regarding IT access for people with disabilities include:</p>  <ul>  <li>when using a PDF format that is not translatable by screen readers<a href=\"#2\"><sup>2</sup></a> (for persons with visual impairments), provide a text-only alternative;</li>  <li>use alt-tags and labels to denote graphics/ pictures;</li>  <li>avoid the use of frames;</li>  <li>avoid the use of Flash and javascript.</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <div id=\"1\"><sup>1</sup> The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative site has a list of tools for website evaluation tools at http://www.w3.org/ WAI/ER/tools/</div>  <div id=\"2\"><sup>2</sup> Go to http://www.afb.org/info_document_view.asp?documentID=1284 for an example of how a screen reader works.</div>  </div>  <h2>Are there other related training responsibilities to consider?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Under the ADA, covered entities cannot use a third party to discriminate on their behalf. Thus, employers may have to consider the possible ADA information needs of organi&shy;zations with which they have contractual relationships, such as insurance companies, third-party administrators of worker compen&shy;sation or health care benefits, labor unions, or employee assistance programs.</p>  <p>ADA Title I prohibits discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability in all terms, conditions, and privileges of employ&shy;ment, including health benefits. The ADA specifically prohibits a covered entity from participating in a discriminatory contractual or other arrangement with any organization that provides fringe benefits to employees.</p>  <p>Where employees are represented by a union, the union steward is the person in the union with whom each member may have direct contact; that is, to whom s/he brings his/ her problems and grievances, from whom s/ he gets information, and who s/he generally sees every day on the job. Management and the union should provide the shop steward with training so that s/he can help dissemi&shy;nate ADA information. In particular, the shop steward should be aware of the union\'s role in informing the workforce about the prohibi&shy;tions against disability discrimination in em&shy;ployment and about the remedy of reasonable accommodation.</p>  <p>A number of ADA employment provisions are relevant to the functioning of Employee As&shy;sistance Program (EAP) professionals. Since EAPs have developed, they have serviced per&shy;sons with addiction problems; certainly these individuals may be covered by the employ&shy;ment provisions of the ADA. Therefore, it is important to provide EAP professionals with information about who qualifies as an individ&shy;ual with a disability under the ADA and what rights such individuals have under the law.</p>  <p>EAP professionals might also be able to assist with accommodation inquiries. SHRM mem&shy;bers indicated in the survey that they would like more information on accommodations for persons with mental health problems, an area in which EAP personnel can be of assistance. In addition, persons with other kinds of dis&shy;abilities may seek support from EAP profes&shy;sionals when facing difficulties in the work&shy;place or elsewhere that arise from a disabling condition or serious illness. EAP professionals may be the counseling and support system that an organization uses, and therefore pro&shy;viding EAP professionals with information about the impact of disability, and the rights of persons with disabilities is most appropriate. EAPs are often also aware of local community resources and can refer employers and super&shy;visors to relevant resources who can help in addressing an accommodation request.</p>  </div>  <h2>Where can I get further resources to conduct training on the Americans with Disabilities Act?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Many private commercial distributors and not-for-profit organizations have now devel&shy;oped informational and training materials on the ADA.

The function of the immune system is to recognize and eliminate agents that are harmful to the host. When the immune system is functioning properly, the foreign agents are eliminated quickly and efficiently. Occasionally, the immune system responds adversely to environmental agents, resulting in an allergic reaction. When the immune system overreacts, the response is out of proportion to, and more harmful than, the initial threat of the environmental agent.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Hypersensitivity, or allergy, is not due to an alteration of the immune system by a foreign substance, but is an inappropriate activation of the immune system. In other words, an allergy is a normal immune response with deleterious consequences, such as allergic rhinitis, hay fever, or contact sensitivity. In some of these cases, the response can be the source of tissue damage, so that suppressing certain immune reactions actually reduces tissue injury. Once sensitized, the affected individual becomes more sensitive to lower concentrations.</p>  <p>This brochure will not discuss all of the various types of allergic reactions an individual might have, but several deserve mention. One type occurs when antibodies bind to the environmental agent (antigen) that has been taken into the body or makes contact with the skin or mucous membranes. The binding reaction causes chemicals from the body to be released, producing dilation of the blood vessels and the release of fluid causing swelling and inflammation. The main targets of this type of reaction are: the skin, producing urticaria (hives) and atopic dermatitis (rash); the respiratory system, producing rhinitis (inflamed nasal passages) and asthma; the vasculature, causing anaphylactic shock; and the gastrointestinal tract, causing food allergies. These responses are called immediate hypersensitivity because they usually occur quickly after reexposure to an antigen to which the individual has been sensitized. Another type of allergic reaction, called delayed hypersensitivity, does not involve antibodies, but produces an inflammatory reaction by the action of specialized types of white blood cells. The target for this type of reaction can be almost any organ, but the classic example is the skin, as in the case of contact dermatitis.</p>  <p>Anaphylactic shock is a dangerous allergic condition in which a reaction takes place all through the body immediately after an antigen to which the person is sensitive has entered the circulatory system. The reaction causes the release of body chemicals that make the arteries and veins dilate, greatly reducing blood pressure in the arteries, and also causes a rapid loss of fluid from the blood and into the tissue spaces. The resulting shock can produce death within minutes.</p>  </div>  <h2>Allergies to Workplace Exposures</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hypersensitivity from environmental exposures in the workplace can produce respiratory disorders, skin disorders, or anaphylactic shock. Numerous inhalants cause immune-mediated respiratory disorders, including some types of bronchial asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis. Immune system involvement has also been seen for silicosis, asbestosis, coal workers\' pneumoconiosis, and possibly byssinosis. Allergic reactions of the skin include allergic contact dermatitis (red rashes, swelling, itching, and sometimes blisters).</p>  <p>Although almost anyone can develop an allergy to a given substance, a distinct segment (15 - 20 percent) of the population is clinically atopic (unusually reactive to a variety of substances). Some individuals could have genetic differences that predispose them to allergies to certain environmental and occupational antigens. Generally, however, the individual who develops occupational asthma is non-atopic (not unusually reactive) and may experience a delayed allergic response in the evening or at night. Characteristically, the individual devel;ops the symptoms of asthma, which include wheezing, shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness. The symptoms improve away from work, but worsen upon return to work.</p>  </div>  <h2>Identifying the Sensitizer in the Work Environment</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>There is an enormous range of potential allergens in the workplace. Documented case histories involve a large number of substances, even though the numbers of people affected by any one substance may be very small. Below are listed some occupational exposures that have been documented as producing allergic reactions. Additional information is available on the allergens that have been shown to be related to specific occupations or exposures.</p>  <p>Some common chemicals associated with occupational asthma include:</p>  <ul>  <li>Platinum salts</li>  <li>Nickel salts</li>  <li>Diisocyanates (such as toluene diisocyanate or TDI)</li>  <li>Ethylenediamine</li>  <li>Phthalic anhydrides</li>  <li>Sodium and potassium persulfates (textile and hair bleaches)</li>  </ul>  <p>Some common occupational exposures associated with allergy include biological agents &ndash; either living organisms, dead organisms, or chemicals extracted/derived from plants or animals:</p>  <ul>  <li>Pyrethrum (from chrysanthemum flowers; used as the bases of some insecticides)</li>  <li>Colophony resins (derived from pine resin)</li>  <li>Fungi (molds): many genera of fungi can produce allergy including both immediate-type allergic reactions such as asthma or hay fever (sometimes accompanied by fungal colonization of mucous secretions) and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Common fungal allergens associated with moisture problems in buildings or with occupations in agriculture, composting, food handling, and food processing include Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Cladosporium species.</li>  <li>Protease enzymes: derived from Bacillus subtilis, used in laundry detergents</li>  <li>Henna</li>  <li>arthropod bites and stings: such as bees and wasps</li>  <li>animal dander, or other proteinaceous byproducts or debris (e.g. book mite excrement)</li>  <li>natural glues</li>  <li>protein additives: such as purified/extracted protein from feathers used in hair conditioners</li>  <li>animal fat, oil, and other products</li>  <li>celery pickers&rsquo; dermatitis (photoallergy)</li>  <li>wood allergies: Western Red Cedar, oak, maple bark, mahogany, pine (dusts, resins)</li>  <li>latex allergy from natural rubber</li>  <li>baker&rsquo;s asthma (flour); grain dusts and grain products; natural glues</li>  <li>perfumes and odorants (such as orris root)</li>  <li>vegetable gums (inc. acacia)</li>  <li>papain</li>  <li>tobacco dust</li>  <li>flax seed, castor bean, soybean, coffee beans</li>  <li>yeasts</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;Some common contact sensitizers of the skin include:</p>  <p>&nbsp;Poison ivy</p>  <ul>  <li>Benzocaine</li>  <li>Mercaptan</li>  <li>Ethylenediamine</li>  <li>Thimerosol</li>  <li>Nickel</li>  <li>Chromium</li>  <li>Silver</li>  <li>Latex</li>  <li>European primrose</li>  <li>Epoxy Resins</li>  <li>Picric acid derivatives</li>  <li>Formaldehyde</li>  <li>Beryllium</li>  <li>Cadmium</li>  <li>Chromates</li>  <li>Zirconium</li>  <li>Metalworking fluids</li>  <li>disinfectants, fabric softeners, and wood preservatives</li>  <li>Paraphenylenediamine</li>  <li>Carbon-iodine hydrocarbon compounds</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Occupational Exposure Limits and the Sensitive Worker</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>It would be most helpful in solving a workplace exposure problem if the specific allergen could be identified and the nature and extent of the exposure documented so that it could be addressed or reduced. Immunotoxicologists have identified many substances that have demonstrable immuno-toxic effects in laboratory animals and, in a few instances, the effects of these substances have been observed in humans as well. Occupational experience has provided some evidence of substances\' effects in humans. For the most part, however, data are sparse on the effects of general exposure to immunotoxicants in the environment, although the scientific community does recognize that the immune system is an important target organ for toxicity.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>Several federal activities are designed to enhance public awareness of the hazards of toxic substances. The Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA)\'s Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200) and Laboratory Standard (29 CFR 1910.1450) require that workers be provided with information about the known health hazards of their jobs. Since so little information is available regarding immunotoxic effects, however, the Standards do little at present to protect workers from potential allergens.</p>  <p>Only a few chemicals are presently regulated by OSHA for which potential sensitization is an adverse health effect specifically considered by the regulation:</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <ul>  <li>Cobalt metal, dust, and fume (Respiratory System)</li>  <li>Formaldehyde (Skin and Respiratory System) (29 CFR 1910.1048)</li>  <li>Isophorone Diisocyanate (Skin and Respiratory System)</li>  <li>Phenyl Glycidyl Ether (Skin)</li>  <li>Picric Acid (Skin)</li>  <li>Toluene-2,4-Diisocyanate (Respiratory System)</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>While some potential sensitizers are regulated in the air contaminants standard (29 CFR 1910.1000), they are not regulated for the purpose of preventing allergy. Also, the regulatory limits set for their concentrations in the air are probably not low enough to prevent allergic reactions, especially in persons with occupational asthma.</p>  <p>Most scientists agree that the lack of human test data should not stop efforts to control human exposures to suspected sensitizers, but the absence of data ensures continued disagreement about suitable means and levels of control. In regulating exposure to potential allergens, the nature of the dose is significant: to prevent adverse health effects, should the exposure be considered over an 8-hour work shift, as one larger dose, or as an intermittent high dose? Some information indicates that perhaps high intermittent doses can result in sensitization or can affect individuals who are sensitive. There is evidence to indicate even a one-time exposure can produce sensitization. A problem with setting exposure limits for an immune system-related response is the challenge of developing an acceptable exposure limit for an event that does not appear to fit the standard dose-response relationship.</p>  </div>  <h2>Accommodating the Allergic Employee</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p class=\"Pa2\">Once an employer learns that an applicant or employee is allergic to a substance in the workplace, the employer will be required to accommodate the employee if he or she meets the definition in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of an individual with a disability. The ADA defines an individual with a disability as someone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Major life activities include actions such as caring for oneself, walking, talking, seeing, breathing, and working. Major life activities also include major bodily functions such as the function of the immune system.</p>  <p>In determining whether an impairment is substantially limiting, ameliorative measures such as medications are not considered. In other words, an employee who successfully controls the adverse effects of exposure to sensitizers through the use of medications could nevertheless qualify as disabled if the effects of that exposure in their unmitigated state substantially limit his or her breathing, the function of his or her immune system, or some other major life activity.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">A reasonable accommodation is a modification or adjustment to a job, the work environment, or the way things usually are done that to enjoy an equal employment opportunity. Employers are not required to provide any accommodation if it would impose an undue hardship upon that employer&rsquo;s business. This determination of what constitutes an undue burden can vary from one employer to the next, depending upon the size of the employer&rsquo;s business, its financial resources and other factors.</p>  <p>The allergic worker may be able to respond to low levels of exposure, levels that may be lower than the relevant occupational exposure limits set by OSHA or recommended by agencies such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) or organizations such as The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). Accommodating the allergic employee would therefore generally involve reducing exposure by providing specific protection for the sensitive individual, such as additional protective equipment the average (non-allergic) worker probably would not need. Protective equipment could involve the use of respirators for respiratory protection or protective clothing (such as gloves) or barrier creams for skin protection. The use of respirators would involve employer compliance with OSHA\'s Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134), including determining whether a worker could wear a respirator.</p>  <p>Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are battery-powered respirators which may enable those with pulmonary or cardiovascular problems to still use a respirator. Respirators made of silicone may enable someone to wear a respirator who has a rubber allergy.</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">Exposure could be reduced by the use of engineering controls such as better or more efficient use of ventilation to dilute or remove exposure; improved equipment design to reduce the production of vapors, mists, and splashes; or enclosures of equipment or processes to contain or collect any emissions. Air cleaning equipment could be used to reduce the air concentration of a potential allergen in the work area of a sensitive individual. Exposure may be reduced by scheduling changes that do not place the sensitive worker in a work area at the same time that a potential allergen is being used. For example, avoiding the use of products such as cleaning chemicals or pesticides or paints in the sensitive person\'s office or work area.</p>  <p>Accommodation includes having personnel aware of what to do or who to call (such as emergency telephone numbers) if the allergic person experiences an adverse reaction such as an asthmatic attack or anaphylactic shock. The allergic person\'s physician can likely recommend appropriate measures (such as having antihistamines or bronchodilators available for emergency use).</p>  <p class=\"Pa2\">There are, however, some other alternatives to consider that could reduce or altogether remove the potential for exposure to an allergen, including product or process substitution. Product substitution involves the use of an alternative formulation for the chemical or material being used in order to eliminate or reduce the potential allergen. For example, to avoid asthma from inhalation of persulfate boosters in hair bleaches, a hairdresser could use bleach with a non-persulfate booster such as sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, or magnesium carbonate. In process substitution, the employer adopts a method of performing a task that reduces or eliminates exposure to the allergen. For example, an employer may choose to sterilize materials by using steam or ultraviolet light rather than a formaldehyde solution and thereby reduce or eliminate skin or respiratory allergies. Both product and process substitution may present additional advantages to the employer in the areas of cost savings on hazardous waste disposal, less potential liability for handling or storage of hazardous materials, reduced need for extra or special ventilation or protective equipment/ clothing, reduced needs for fire or other types of insurance, and reduced workers\' compensation costs for injuries or illnesses. Moreover, substitutions may have the added advantage of reducing exposure for other workers who have not yet shown any adverse health effects.</p>  <p>For some chemical exposures, it may be possible to have medical testing to determine if an individual is likely to have an allergic reaction to an exposure or to diagnose hyper-reactive respiratory airways. To assure compliance with the ADA and to protect the individual&rsquo;s privacy, it is important that such testing be performed only after the employer has made a job offer and that it be performed by a physician who reports to the employer only the information as to whether the employee can perform the requirements of the job and what accommodations might be necessary to enable him/her to do so.</p>  <p>Accommodating an allergic employee should involve understanding the individual&rsquo;s experience of the nature and severity of his/her condition by considering the following aspects of the allergy:</p>  <ul>  <li>What is the severity of the harm: for example, would this be a fatal asthmatic reaction or a nonspecific asthma with short-term reversible symptoms? What is the employee doing and where, if the harm occurs? For example, is this a clerical worker near good medical facilities or an on-duty police officer, firefighter, or airline pilot?</li>  <li>What is the likelihood of the allergic event: exclusion from the job may be justified if the event has a high probability of occurring; this depends entirely on methods of workplace hazard control, rather than on the clinical state of the allergic worker.</li>  <li>What is the imminence or time course of the event, especially if it is likely to occur in the near future; for example, a severe asthma attack is generally more imminent than development of a bronchogenic carcinoma?</li>  <li>What is the duration of the personal risk for a worker with asthma, when the severity of the illness is temporary?</li>  </ul>  <p>With this approach, accommodation can be done using good information and judgment, without &ldquo;protecting&rdquo; the employee out of a job.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,'This publication was written in 1994 and  updated in February 2002 and May 2010 by  Nellie J.

The employment provisions in Title I prohibit discrimination against persons with disabilities in recruitment, pre-employment screening, hiring, promotions, layoffs and termination&rsquo;s, and any other term, condition, or privilege of employment. Title I covers private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, and labor unions.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is Total Quality Management?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Total quality management (TQM) is a form of doing business in which managers and line employees work cooperatively toward improved quality and productivity. Three components are necessary for total quality management to flourish in any company: participatory management, continuous process improvement, and use of teams.</p>  <p><b>Participatory management</b> is a process of trust and feedback that evolves between managers and employees. It means providing individual employees and teams with the skills and support they need to understand better how they do business, help improve the production process, and participate in making changes in the organization. A 1992 Gallup poll revealed that 39 percent of American managers had a quality improvement program in place and were pleased by the results.</p>  <p><b>Continuous process improvement</b> means, accepting small, incremental gains as steps toward total quality. This approach enables employees to develop confidence in the total quality management process and gives managers opportunities to support and encourage employees and teams. Each process is studied, often by the employee responsible for doing it, to see how it can be improved.</p>  <p><b>Cross-functional teams</b> (sometimes called quality improvement teams) meet frequently using TQM principles to study a particular area that needs work.</p>  </div>  <h2>What Is \"Reasonable Accommodation\" under the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Reasonable accommodation, a critical concept in the employment provisions (Title I) of the ADA is a modification or adjustment to a job, employment practice, or work environment that enables a qualified individual with a disability to participate in and enjoy equal employment opportunity. The employer\'s obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation applies to all aspects of employment. This requirement may arise anytime a person\'s disability or job changes, unless the accommodation causes an undue hardship to the employer.</p>  <p>An undue hardship is an action that poses significant difficulty or expense in relation to the size of the company, available resources, or the nature of the business. A qualified individual with a disability or employee cannot be denied an employment opportunity solely because of the need to provide reasonable accommodation. If the employer can show that the cost of the accommodation would impose an undue hardship, it would still be required to provide the accommodation if funding is available from another source, e.g. a State vocational rehabilitation agency, or if tax deductions or credits are available to offset the cost of the accommodation. In the absence of such funding, the individual with the disability requesting the accommodation should be given the option of providing the accommodation or of paying that portion which constitutes the undue hardship on the operation of the business.</p>  </div>  <h2>How Can TQM Be Used to Help Implement the ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Total quality management can be used when implementing the ADA so as to improve human resource practices in general, in addition to increasing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. The advantages of TQM apply not only to human resource departments responsible for recruitment, hiring, and employment in both large and small companies.</p>  <p>At least four features of total quality management focus on improvements in the workplace that can benefit all employees.</p>  <p>These four features are:</p>  <ul>  <li>capacity building</li>  <li>universal design</li>  <li>focus on strengths rather than deficits</li>  <li>use data for decision making</li>  </ul>  <p><b>Emphasis on capacity building</b> calls both for changing human resource methods and building the changes into day-to-day practice. Under the ADA, an employer may be required to make modifications or adjustments to a job application process that enable a qualified applicant to be considered for the position desired. Improving the capacity of human resource processes enhances opportunities for people with disabilities and all other potential employees.</p>  <p><b>Universal design concepts</b> accommodate the diversity of the current and future workforce, including persons with disabilities. Whereas universal design is frequently discussed in terms of physical accessibility and environmental modifications, the same principles apply to services and processes. For example, the use of icons on application forms and computer programs allows a much broader range of people to recognize immediately the information needed.</p>  <p><b>Focus on strengths rather than deficits</b> create the potential for configuring job duties to take advantage of individual differences. Traditional hiring processes often emphasize assumed requirements that extend beyond the essential functions of a specific job. As a result, they may eliminate potential employees who have transferable skills but do not meet all assumed requirements.</p>  <p><b>Use of data for decision making</b> includes evaluation of progress and ways to improve processes. If a company intends to increase the diversity of its workforce by hiring employees with disabilities, then data about progress in recruiting, interviewing, and hiring will provide feedback about the effectiveness of its new human resource practices.</p>  </div>  <h2>How can the Planning Process of Total Quality Management Be Applied to Reasonable Accommodation?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Most organizations that use total quality management use the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle or a variation of it. Plan-Do-Check-Act can be used as a blueprint for supervisors faced with the need to provide a reasonable accommodation. The steps, spelled out below, can also help in devising an appropriate accommodation for a particular individual.</p>  <p><b>Plan.</b> The individual with a disability and his or her supervisor should discuss the needed accommodation, evaluate alternative solutions, and select those that appear best. Worker, manager, and other experts work as a team. The President\'s Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities\' Job Accommodation Network (see below) can help.</p>  <p><b>Do.</b> Once the employee and his or her supervisor or employer agrees on an accommodation, it can be implemented. This should be done with the understanding that the accommodation may need to be reexamined and updated in the event of a job change or a change in the status of the employee\'s disability.</p>  <p><b>Check.</b> Assess whether the accommodation is working. Ask the individual, observe outcomes of the individual\'s work, and observe the worker. If there are problems, return to the planning portion of the cycle.</p>  <p><b>Act.</b> The request for accommodation may signal action needed to assess the causes of work-related injury to prevent future such occurrences. Also, the information gained overtime on accommodations can be helpful if similar such accommodations are needed in the future.</p>  </div>  <h2>Educating Personnel about the ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Because the ADA applies to all aspects of participation in society, including employment, public accommodations, transportation, and telecommunications, it will affect businesses both as employers and as providers of goods and services. Each business organization must educate its employees on the provisions of the ADA, its relevance to the functioning of the organization as a whole, and the responsibilities of specific personnel.</p>  <p>One way to introduce ADA nondiscrimination material might be to add it to TQM training efforts, which are being offered by many companies. A familiar term in TQM is bench-marking. Bench-marking is a formalized process for assessing current practices in work performance and outcomes and comparing that with desired or superior performance processes and outcomes. For example, training supervisors on effective bench-marking for unit effectiveness could include the number of work-related injuries for a particular quarter or the number of persons with disabilities who are newly recruited in the workplace. Using such examples will raise awareness of disability discrimination issues in the context of total quality management training for the organization.</p>  </div>  <h2>Other ADA-related information of particular relevance to supervisors includes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <ul>  <li>employment prescreening and applicant interviewing</li>  <li>medical, drug, and other testing</li>  <li>identification of essential job functions</li>  <li>and equal access for persons with disabilities to staff development and promotional opportunities.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Reference</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Jablonski, J.R.

Bajo las normas de la ADA los empleadores deben ofrecer acomodaciones razonables a menos que &eacute;sto les cause un costo excesivo. Una &ldquo;acomodaci&oacute;n razonable&rdquo; es un cambio en el sitio de trabajo que permite que el empleado(a) pueda llevar a cabo las funciones esenciales del cargo. El permiso de licencia de ausentismo es una forma de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que permite al empleado dejar de trabajar por un tiempo, hacer lo necesario para resolver el problema por el cual solicit&oacute; la licencia, y luego poder reintegrarse a su puesto original llevando a cabo las funciones esenciales del cargo.</p>  <p>En algunos casos los permisos de licencia a corto o largo plazo, o a&uacute;n por algunas horas, puede ser la &uacute;nica acomodaci&oacute;n razonable efectiva.<sup>2</sup> En otros casos los permisos de licencia pueden ser una forma efectiva de acomodaci&oacute;n, pero pueden haber otras formas efectivas que le permitir&iacute;an seguir trabajando. De acuerdo con las normas de la ADA el empleador debe negociar con el trabajador que solicita la acomodaci&oacute;n, para tomar una decisi&oacute;n final acerca de la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable m&aacute;s efectiva que deber&aacute; ser prove&iacute;da.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup>Las regulaciones de la EEOC que hacen cumplir con la ADA se disponen en el c&oacute;digo 29 C.F.R.

La FMLA aplica a:</p>  <p>*Empleadores estatales, locales o nacionales y a las diferentes agencias locales de educaci&oacute;n (escuelas) *Empleadores del sector privado con 50 o m&aacute;s empleados que trabajan al menos 20 semanas laborales en el a&ntilde;o presente o el anterior, incluyendo los empleadores que reci&eacute;n se integran a la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a o aquellos que reemplazan a otros trabajadores.</p>  <p>El Departamento Administrativo de Est&aacute;ndares de Regulaci&oacute;n Laboral de los EE.UU., su divisi&oacute;n de Salarios y N&uacute;mero de Horas hace cumplir las normas de la FMLA con respecto a empleados en el sector privado, en el gobierno local o estatal y algunos en el gobierno federal. La mayor&iacute;a de empleados del gobierno federal y del Congreso est&aacute;n bajo la jurisdicci&oacute;n de la Oficina Administrativa del personal o del Congreso.</p>  <p>Para poder recibir el permiso de licencia de la FMLA, el empleado debe trabajar para un empleador cubierto y adem&aacute;s:</p>  <p>1. Haber trabajado para este empleador por lo menos por doce meses;</p>  <p>2. Haber trabajado al menos 1250 horas durante los doce meses previos al principio del permiso de licencia de la FMLA; y,</p>  <p>3. Trabajar en un sitio donde haya al menos 50 empleados, o trabajar en una sucursal de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a, que aunque tenga menos de 50 empleados, est&eacute; localizada a menos de 75 millas de otra sucursal que complemente el n&uacute;mero de empleados (50) requeridos para estar cubierto bajo la FMLA.</p>  <p>El total del tiempo trabajado se cuenta para cumplir con el requisito de los doce meses de empleo. El requisito de 1250 horas puede ser satisfecho de varias formas, incluyendo un trabajo regular de tiempo completo con al menos 104 horas al mes por doce meses, o trabajando 24 horas a la semana por 52 semanas.</p>  <p>Derecho de Permiso de Licencia</p>  Un empleador cubierto bajo este programa debe ofrecerle a un empleado elegible hasta 12 semanas de permiso de licencia en un per&iacute;odo de 12 meses por una o m&aacute;s de las siguientes razones:  <p>*Por el nacimiento de un beb&eacute; y el cuidado del reci&eacute;n nacido;</p>  <p>*Cuando se recibe un ni&ntilde;o o ni&ntilde;a en adopci&oacute;n permanente o para su cuidado temporal;</p>  <p>*Para cuidar a un miembro de la familia, como su pareja, hijo, padre o madre, (excluyendo al suegro o suegra) que sufre de problemas de salud serios; y,</p>  <p>*Cuando el empleado no puede trabajar por una condici&oacute;n de salud grave.</p>  <p>El permiso de licencia para cuidar a un beb&eacute; reci&eacute;n nacido o recientemente adoptado debe finalizar antes de 12 meses despu&eacute;s del nacimiento o la adopci&oacute;n.

La licencia programada reducida o peri&oacute;dica puede tomarse con el fin de cuidar a un beb&eacute; reci&eacute;n nacido o un ni&ntilde;o reci&eacute;n adoptado s&oacute;lo si el empleador lo aprueba.</p>  <p>Empleados que necesitan una licencia peri&oacute;dica o reducida programada de antemano debido a un tratamiento m&eacute;dico que se puede anticipar, deben llegar a un acuerdo con su empleador para programar la licencia de tal forma que no afecte negativamente el funcionamiento de la empresa, sujeto a la aprobaci&oacute;n del equipo m&eacute;dico a cargo del empleado. En tales casos el empleador puede transferir al empleado temporalmente a otro puesto con salario y prestaciones similares en el que se pueda ajustar mejor los per&iacute;odos repetitivos de licencia en comparaci&oacute;n con el puesto regular del empleado.</p>  <p>Uso del Permiso de Licencia Remunerada</p>  <p>Hay dos posibilidades con respecto a las licencias remuneradas: la primera posibilidad es que los empleados decidan usar el tiempo acumulado de licencia autorizada por la FMLA para cubrir parte o toda la licencia utilizada, o la segunda es que el empleador obligue al empleado a usar este tiempo. Los empleados pueden decidir, (o los empleadores pueden requerir), la sustituci&oacute;n de prestaciones de vacaciones remuneradas acumuladas, o permiso de licencia personal, por alguna de las situaciones amparadas por la FMLA. La sustituci&oacute;n de la licencia acumulada por enfermedad o por razones familiares est&aacute; limitada por las pol&iacute;ticas de los empleadores con respecto al uso de estas licencias.</p>  <p>Notificaci&oacute;n y Certificaci&oacute;n</p>  <p>Los empleados pueden estar obligados a dar 30 d&iacute;as de aviso antes de tomar una licencia autorizada por la FMLA, cuando la necesidad pueda ser anticipada. El empleador puede requerir que la licencia solicitada por la condici&oacute;n seria de salud del empleado o de un miembro cercano de su familia, debe estar corroborada por una certificaci&oacute;n de su m&eacute;dico. Existe un formulario del Departamento de Trabajo que ha sido aprobado para este fin. El empleador no puede hacer una solicitud generalizada para obtener informaci&oacute;n de expedientes m&eacute;dicos.</p>  <p>Reintegraci&oacute;n al Trabajo</p>  <p>Una vez el empleado(a) ha terminado la licencia autorizada por la FMLA, &eacute;ste(a) debe ser reintegrado a su cargo original, o a un cargo &ldquo;equivalente&rdquo;, o sea pr&aacute;cticamente id&eacute;ntico al cargo original en cuanto a salario, prestaciones y otros t&eacute;rminos y condiciones de trabajo. Adem&aacute;s, solo porque un empleado use la licencia autorizada por la FMLA, este no significa que &eacute;l pueda perder ninguna prestaci&oacute;n que se merece por estar en dicho cargo y a las que ten&iacute;a derecho antes de haber solicitado la licencia de la FMLA. En algunas circunstancias, el empleador puede rehusarse a reintegrar a ciertos &ldquo;empleados claves&rdquo; con un nivel de salario elevado si el mantenerlo en el cargo le pudiera causar una carga econ&oacute;mica sustancial, afectando el funcionamiento de la empresa.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup>La regulaciones del Departamento de Trabajo acerca de FMLA se disponen en c&oacute;digo 29 C.F.R. , parte 825</div>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Cuando se Interrelacionan la Cobertura de la FMLA con la Cobertura de la Ley ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los empleadores privados con 50 o m&aacute;s empleados est&aacute;n cubiertos por ambas leyes (la FMLA y la ADA). Empleadores del gobierno estatal y local tambi&eacute;n est&aacute;n cubiertos por ambas leyes, sin importar el n&uacute;mero de empleados. Las personas calificadas con deshabilidades protegidas bajo las normas de la ADA, deben cumplir con los requisitos de calificaci&oacute;n de la FMLA en cuanto a haber trabajado al menos un total de 12 meses y al menos 1250 horas de trabajo en los &uacute;ltimos 12 meses, para poder recibir la licencia de la FMLA.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Bajo la FMLA una &ldquo;condici&oacute;n de salud grave&rdquo; es equivalente a una deshabilidad bajo la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No necesariamente. Una deshabilidad, de acuerdo a la ADA, se define como una limitaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica o mental que afecta de forma considerable una actividad principal en la vida de la persona, as&iacute; como tener un antecedente de padecer tal limitaci&oacute;n, o asumir que esta persona padece de tal limitaci&oacute;n. Algunas condiciones de salud graves que est&aacute;n bajo la FMLA (como los diferentes tipos de c&aacute;ncer, las enfermedades del coraz&oacute;n y los derrames cerebrales serios) probablemente se considerar&iacute;an como deshabilidades bajo la ADA. Otras condiciones de salud como el embarazo, la apendicectom&iacute;a, o una fractura de una pierna pueden ser condiciones de salud serias, pero por lo general no cumplir&iacute;an con la definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad de la ADA.</p>  <p>As&iacute; mismo, el estar diagnosticado con una condici&oacute;n de salud grave puede o no ser considerada como un antecedente de tener una deshabilidad. De igual manera, s&oacute;lo porque el empleador sabe que una persona sufre de una condici&oacute;n de salud seria no quiere decir que el empleador debe considerar a dicha persona como un empleado con una deshabilidad bajo la definici&oacute;n de la ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Son las Preguntas de Certificaci&oacute;n de la FMLA permitidas bajo la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>S&iacute;. Cuando un empleado solicita una licencia de acuerdo a las normas de la FMLA debido a una condici&oacute;n seria de salud, los empleadores no estar&iacute;an infringiendo la ADA al basar sus preguntas espec&iacute;ficamente en el formulario de certificaci&oacute;n de la FMLA. El empleador tiene el derecho de saber por qu&eacute; un empleado que normalmente deber&iacute;a estar trabajando solicita una licencia de ausentismo autorizada bajo la FMLA. Este tipo de preguntas espec&iacute;ficas estar&iacute;an relacionadas con el puesto y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa y no estar&iacute;an violando las normas de la ADA.</p>  <p>Un empleador puede tener un expediente m&eacute;dico del empleado, que debe mantenerse separado del expediente regular del departamento de personal el cual contiene la informaci&oacute;n de la FMLA y de la ADA, siempre y cuando se cumpla con los requisitos de confidencialidad de la ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>Comparaci&oacute;n General Sobre las Licencias bajo las Normas de la ADA y la FMLA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La FMLA permite un m&aacute;ximo de 12 semanas de permiso de licencia sin remuneraci&oacute;n durante un per&iacute;odo de 12 meses. Una persona calificada con una deshabilidad tiene derecho a m&aacute;s de 12 semanas de licencia sin remuneraci&oacute;n como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, siempre y cuando esta licencia no afecte considerablemente el funcionamiento de la empresa.</p>  <p>La FMLA autoriza que las 12 semanas de licencia se tomen de forma peri&oacute;dica o en un horario de trabajo reducido (por ejemplo, una semana de 3 d&iacute;as laborales en vez de 5, hasta que las 12 semanas se hayan utilizado). La FMLA tambi&eacute;n permite que el empleador exija que el empleado sea transferido a otro puesto con salario y prestaciones similares mientras el empleado termina la licencia.</p>  <p>De acuerdo a las normas de la ADA una persona calificada con una deshabilidad puede trabajar medio tiempo o tomar tiempo libre ocasionalmente, siempre y cuando &eacute;sto no cause un costo excesivo al empleador. En caso de que &eacute;sto cause una carga excesiva al empleador, &eacute;ste debe tratar de reasignar al empleado a un puesto equivalente que este vacante y en &uacute;ltima instancia a un puesto vacante de menor nivel para poder continuar la licencia o el horario de trabajo reducido. Por supuesto, el empleador y el empleado siempre pueden llegar a un acuerdo sobre la transferencia a otro puesto si ambos consideran que esto es preferible a tener que acomodar a la persona en su puesto actual.</p>  <p>Tenga en cuenta que una persona calificada con una deshabilidad que est&aacute; utilizando una licencia autorizada por la FMLA para trabajar menos horas, tambi&eacute;n puede necesitar de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable (por ejemplo, aparatos especiales) para cumplir con las funciones esenciales del puesto.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Cu&aacute;ndo debe el Empleador mantener al Empleado en el Trabajo?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Bajo la ADA un empleador puede ofrecerle a un empleado una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable diferente a la licencia solicitada, siempre y cuando esta sea efectiva. Por ejemplo, un empleador puede ofrecerle al empleado el uso de aparatos especiales, la oportunidad de trabajar con un horario reducido en el puesto actual, o la reasignaci&oacute;n temporal a otro puesto, siempre y cuando estas acomodaciones sean efectivas.</p>  <p>Sin embargo, si la persona es elegible para recibir el permiso de licencia de la FMLA y sufre de una condici&oacute;n de salud seria que no le permite a &eacute;l /ella llevar a cabo alguna funci&oacute;n esencial del cargo, ella / &eacute;l tiene el derecho de tomar una licencia de hasta 12 semanas laborales en un per&iacute;odo de 12 meses, a&uacute;n si ella / &eacute;l pudiera seguir trabajando con una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. La FMLA no limita a un empleado a aceptar alguna otra alternativa a la licencia, siempre y cuando este acuerdo se haga voluntariamente y sin presiones.</p>  </div>  <h2>Reintegraci&oacute;n al Trabajo</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Bajo la ADA el empleado tiene el derecho de reintegrarse al mismo cargo a menos que el empleador demuestre que mantener el puesto abierto le ocasionar&iacute;a un costo excesivo. En este caso la reasignaci&oacute;n a otro puesto podr&iacute;a considerarse de acuerdo a lo mencionado anteriormente. Se debe considerar una reasignaci&oacute;n en caso que la persona siendo reintegrada a su puesto original no pueda cumplir con las funciones esenciales del cargo, a&uacute;n con el uso de las acomodaciones razonables.</p>  <p>De acuerdo con la FMLA, la persona puede ser reasignada al mismo puesto o a uno posici&oacute;n equivalente, es decir a un puesto virtualmente id&eacute;ntico en salario, prestaciones y otros t&eacute;rminos y condiciones del empleo. Si un empleado no puede cumplir con las funciones esenciales del cargo o del puesto equivalente, la FMLA no requiere la reasignaci&oacute;n a otro puesto.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Cobertura del Seguro</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>De acuerdo a las normas de la ADA, el empleador debe continuar cubriendo el seguro de salud del empleado que esta tomando la licencia o trabajando medio tiempo, s&oacute;lo si &eacute;l ofrece tambi&eacute;n esta cobertura a otros empleados en la misma categor&iacute;a de licencia o de trabajo de medio tiempo. Bajo la FMLA el empleador siempre debe mantener el nivel actual de cobertura en el plan de salud del grupo, mientras la persona este tomando la licencia bajo la FMLA, y contin&uacute;e pagando su parte de la cuota. Otras prestaciones como seguro de vida o de deshabilidad tambi&eacute;n deben ser ofrecidos al empleado que esta tomando la licencia bajo la FMLA, si estas prestaciones se ofrecen a otros empleados que est&eacute;n tomando la misma licencia, o est&eacute;n en la misma categor&iacute;a de trabajo de medio tiempo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Cumplimiento con las Normas de la FMLA y la ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Cuando un empleado pide una licencia por una raz&oacute;n posiblemente relacionada con una deshabilidad (por ejemplo, una solicitud de 6 semanas de licencia para recibir tratamiento por problemas de la espalda), el empleador debe considerar &eacute;sto tanto como una solicitud para una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable bajo la ADA, as&iacute; como una solicitud de licencia bajo la FMLA. Sin embargo, si el empleado aclara que s&oacute;lo quiere la licencia bajo la FMLA, el empleador no debe hacer otras preguntas sobre la cobertura de la ADA.</p>  <p>En caso que la ADA y la FMLA se puedan aplicar a las primeras 12 semanas de licencia m&eacute;dica del empleado, las reglas de la FMLA determinan que el empleador debe ofrecer la licencia bajo las condiciones que le brinden al empleado el mayor n&uacute;mero de derechos.</p>  <p>Por ejemplo, una persona calificada con deshabilidad que se considera tambi&eacute;n como un &ldquo;empleado elegible&rdquo;con derecho a la licencia bajo la FMLA, solicita 10 semanas de licencia m&eacute;dica como una forma de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que el empleador autoriza porque &eacute;sto no le causa un costo excesivo. El empleador le indica al empleado que las 10 semanas de licencia le ser&aacute;n designas como un permiso de licencia bajo la FMLA y se contar&aacute;n como parte de los derechos de licencia del empleado bajo esta ley. Lo anterior no impide que las partes consideren la licencia como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para reintegrar al empleado al mismo puesto, lo cual se considerar&iacute;a como un derecho mayor adquirido bajo la ADA, en lugar de ser reintegrado a un puesto equivalente bajo las normas de la FMLA. Al mismo tiempo el empleado tiene el derecho, bajo la FMLA, de que el empleador mantenga las prestaciones del plan de salud del grupo durante la licencia, ya que &eacute;sto ofrece m&aacute;s derechos para el empleado.</p>  </div>  <h2>Licencia por Razones Familiares</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La FMLA requiere que el empleador autorice la licencia al empleado(a) para cuidar a su pareja, hija o hijo, o padre o madre con problemas graves de salud. El requisito de la ADA sobre acomodaciones razonables no obliga al empleador a darle a un empleado permiso de licencia para cuidar a un miembro de la familia que tiene una deshabilidad. Por supuesto, si un empleador decide ofrecer la licencia por razones de familia como prestaci&oacute;n del empleado, el empleador debe ofrecer la licencia sin discriminar contra otros.</p>  </div>  <h2>Informaci&oacute;n sobre la FMLA y Quejas</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Si necesita informaci&oacute;n adicional sobre la FMLA o requiere iniciar una demanda bajo la FMLA, debe ponerse en contacto con la oficina m&aacute;s cercana de la Divisi&oacute;n de Salarios y Horas de la Administraci&oacute;n de Requisitos Laborales del Departamento de Trabajo de los Estados Unidos.

El T&iacute;tulo I de la A.D.A. prohibe la discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de individuos calificados con deshabilidad bajo todos los t&eacute;rminos y condiciones del empleo, como por ejemplo en el reclutamiento, en la evaluaci&oacute;n de pre-empleo, en la contrataci&oacute;n, en las prestaciones, ascensos, cesaci&oacute;n de trabajo y despido. Empleadores con 15 o m&aacute;s empleados est&aacute;n sujetos a las regulaciones del T&iacute;tulo I de la A.D.A. como tambi&eacute;n lo son las organizaciones laborales, las agencias de empleo y los comit&eacute;s de co-administraci&oacute;n laboral.</p>  <p>Bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A., un empleador no puede negarle a un individuo con deshabilidad la oportunidad de solicitar un puesto, por el hecho de haber pedido una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable durante el proceso de solicitud. Tampoco un empleador puede negarle a un solicitante o a un empleado calificado que tiene una deshabilidad, la oportunidad de empleo por el hecho de pedir o necesitar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para poder desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del cargo. No es obligatorio que el empleador ofrezca una acomodaci&oacute;n si &eacute;sta constituye una carga o costo excesivo.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;De qu&eacute; manera la A.D.A. afecta a los empleadores sindicalizados?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los empleadores del sector privado cuyos empleados est&aacute;n representados por un sindicato est&aacute;n bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. y la Ley Nacional sobre Relaciones Laborales (N.L.R.A.). Bajo las regulaciones de la N.L.R.A., el sindicato es el representante exclusivo de los empleados y se le prohibe a un empleador negociar directamente con los empleados los t&eacute;rminos y las condiciones de empleo. Adem&aacute;s, la N.L.R.A. prohibe que un empleador lleve a cabo cualquier cambio en los t&eacute;rminos y condiciones de empleo, sin ofrecerle al sindicato la oportunidad de negociar los cambios propuestos.</p>  <p>La A.D.A. prohibe que los empleadores y los sindicatos lleguen a acuerdos de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva que discriminan en contra de los individuos protegidos por la A.D.A..</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Cu&aacute;les son las obligaciones de un sindicato bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. y de la N.L.R.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las disposiciones de la A.D.A. sobre discriminaci&oacute;n en el empleo se aplican a los sindicatos en calidad de empleadores y negociadores. Bajo las regulaciones de la N.L.R.A., un sindicato tiene la obligaci&oacute;n de representar justamente a sus miembros, o sea, que se exige que un sindicato actue razonablemente en una forma no- discriminatoria y en buena fe con relaci&oacute;n a los empleados que representa. Esta obligaci&oacute;n podr&iacute;a exigirle al sindicato que ayude a un empleado a solicitar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable y trabaje con el empleador para determinar las acomodaciones razonables disponibles al empleado.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es una &ldquo;acomodaci&oacute;n razonable&rdquo; bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable es cualquier modificaci&oacute;n o ajuste a un puesto, a una pol&iacute;tica de empleo, o al ambiente de trabajo que permite a un individuo calificado que tiene una deshabilidad participar y gozar de igualdad de oportunidades en el empleo. El prop&oacute;sito esencial de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable es el de permitir a un individuo calificado que tenga una deshabilidad de desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del cargo.</p>  <p>Las acomodaciones razonables incluyen el cambio o ajuste del proceso de solicitud para ofrecerle a los individuos calificados que tienen deshabilidades la oportunidad de solicitar el puesto; tambi&eacute;n incluyen la r&aacute;pida adaptaci&oacute;n de los establecimientos que puedan ser accesibles y utilizados por personas con deshabilidades, haciendo cambios a los horarios de trabajo, cambio a un puesto vacante, la redistribuci&oacute;n de las funciones no- esenciales del cargo y la adquisici&oacute;n o modificaci&oacute;n de equipos o aparatos. Un empleador no est&aacute; obligado a crear puestos de trabajo que &ldquo;requieran de un menor esfuerzo&rdquo;, ni a redistribuir las funciones esenciales del trabajo que no se consideren una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>Un empleador no est&aacute; obligado a ofrecer una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable si &eacute;sta constituye una carga o costo excesivo para el mismo. Para que realmente una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable constituya una carga o un costo excesivo se debe a factores como el tipo de acomodac&oacute;in, su costo y el tama&ntilde;o y la naturaleza de la empresa. Los t&eacute;rminos de un acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva podr&iacute;an ser importantes para determinar si una acomodaci&oacute;n espec&iacute;fica es la causa de una carga o costo excesivo y si debiese ser revisada y considerada cuando un empleado solicite una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Un empleador no puede afirmar que una acomodaci&oacute;n constituir&aacute; una carga o costo excesivo, por el simple hecho de que el mismo es una de las partes involucradas en el acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;En qu&eacute; consiste el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las regulaciones de la A.D.A. exigen que el individuo con deshabilidad y el empleador tomen parte en un proceso interactivo para determinar si existe una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Primeramente, el individuo que tiene una deshabilidad debe solicitar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Si el empelador no lo ha hecho, debe determinar las funciones del cargo en cuesti&oacute;n. El empleador y el individuo deben luego determinar las limitaciones relacionadas al trabajo impuestas por la deshabilidad del individuo, y &eacute;sto podr&iacute;a requerir un di&aacute;logo e informaci&oacute;n acerca del estado de salud del individuo y de que manera estas limitaciones pueden ser superadas gracias a una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Las posibles acomodaciones deber&iacute;an ser evaluadas y se deber&iacute;a seleccionar una acomodaci&oacute;n eficaz. Aun que se considere la preferencia del empleado, el empleador tiene el privilegio de escoger entre acomodaciones razonables de igual eficacia. La A.D.A. exige que la informaci&oacute;n sobre solicitantes de trabajo y empleados se mantenga confidencial y separada de los archivos del personal. Las personas involucradas en el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que tienen acceso a este tipo de informaci&oacute;n, tienen la obligaci&oacute;n constante de mantener la confidencialidad de la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Se le exige al empleador que cumpla con sus obligaciones bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. y de la N.L.R.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los empleadores deben cumplir con las regulaciones de ambos estatutos* y balancear los intereses presentados por un empleado que pide una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A., y sus obligaciones bajo la N.L.R.A. Con respecto a su relaci&oacute;n con el sindicato y los requisitos de un acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva. La Comisi&oacute;n para la Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo (EEOC), que es la agencia federal responsable para el cumplimiento de las regulaciones de la A.D.A., ha rechazado el argumento que una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable constituye una carga o costo excesivo simplemente por que infringe un acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha declarado que un empleador inicialmente deber&iacute;a determinar si puede proveer una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que elimine la barrera en el lugar de trabajo sin infringir el acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva. Si no existe tal acomodaci&oacute;n, el empleador y el sindicato deber&iacute;an tratar de negociar una variaci&oacute;n al acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva que esta en conflicto con la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable solicitada, como puede ser una asignaci&oacute;n a funciones de trabajo &ldquo;m&aacute;s livianas&rdquo; o transferir el empleado a otro cargo con requisitos f&iacute;sicos y mentales distintos, en el caso en que no exista otra acomodaci&oacute;n efectiva y los dem&aacute;s trabajadores no se vean cargados excesivamente. Un empleador no puede usar la existencia de un acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva como excusa para no ofrecer o implementar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, a menos que pueda demostrar que la solicitud tendr&iacute;a un efecto negativo sobre los dem&aacute;s empleados en la unidad de negociaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>El Consejo General Directivo Nacional para Relaciones Laborales (the General Counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB), la agencia federal responsable del cumplimiento de las regulaciones de la NLRA, ha declarado que un empleador no necesita negociar con el sindicato que representa a sus empleados, cuando una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable no afecta los t&eacute;rminos y las condiciones del empleo, como por ejemplo el levantar un escritorio usando bloques, proveer una rampa, proveer se&ntilde;ales en c&oacute;digo Braille o brindar un int&eacute;rprete, y el empleado puede solicitar estas acomodaciones directamente al empleador. Los empleadores estar&iacute;an obligados a negociar con el sindicato si la acomodaci&oacute;n solicitada causara un cambio material, sustancial o significativo en los t&eacute;rminos y las condiciones de empleo, como puede ser requerir un cambio en el acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva. La mayor&iacute;a de los tribunales que han considerado la relaci&oacute;n entre los acuerdos de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva y las acomodaciones razonables han llegado a la conclusi&oacute;n que una acomodaci&oacute;n particular que afecte los derechos de antig&uuml;edad de otros empleados no se puede considerar razonable, y por lo tanto si un empleador y un sindicato rechazan tal acomodaci&oacute;n &eacute;sto no infringe las regulaciones de la A.D.A.</p>  <p>Sin embargo, las partes involucradas, o sea, el empleador, el sindicato y el individuo que solicita la acomodaci&oacute;n todav&iacute;a estar&iacute;an obligados a tomar parte en el proceso interactivo de buena fe para determinar si exist&iacute;a alg&uacute;n otro tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; tipo de medidas proactivas est&aacute;n al alcance de empleadores y sindicatos para cumplir con los requisitos de la A.D.A. y de la N.L.R.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Empleadores y sindicatos podr&iacute;an eliminar o reducir los posibles conflictos entre la A.D.A. y la N.L.R.A. a trav&eacute;s de una colaboraci&oacute;n en planeaci&oacute;n a largo plazo. Empleadores y sindicatos pueden crear un ambiente de cooperaci&oacute;n con respecto a sus obligaciones bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. y de la N.L.R.A. Desde un principio el empleador y el sindicato deber&iacute;an revisar su acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva para asegurarse que los individuos no est&eacute;n sujetos a discriminaci&oacute;n por deshabilidad. El empleador y el sindicato tambi&eacute;n pueden empezar a considerar la inclusi&oacute;n de protecciones o salvaguardias espec&iacute;ficas en el contrato para individuos con deshabilidades, procedimientos para el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable o el desarrollo de un programa de &ldquo;actividades leves&rdquo;. Los empleadores y los sindicatos tambi&eacute;n podr&iacute;an ofrecer programas educativos sobre la A.D.A., como por ejemplo di&aacute;logos abiertos sobre el impacto de la A.D.A. en el ambiente de trabajo, por parte tanto de la gerencia como del personal del sindicato. Se podr&iacute;a constituir un comit&eacute; conjunto entre el empleador y el sindicato para dialogar y tratar temas sobre el cumplimiento de las regulaciones de la A.D.A. El comit&eacute; conjunto podr237&amp;#;a considerar las solicitudes para acomodaciones razonables y trabajar con los empleados en el proceso informal interactivo para identificar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. El comit&eacute; podr&iacute;a tambi&eacute;n asistir en el proceso de determinar las funciones esenciales del cargo, revisar que acomodaciones son necesarias, y que acomodaciones son disponibles o son posibles en el contexto del acuerdo de negociaci&oacute;n colectiva.</p>  <p>La A.D.A. tiene protecciones espec&iacute;ficas sobre la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica del empleado, y tanto los empleadores como los sindicatos tienen la obligaci&oacute;n de mantener confidencial la informaci&oacute;n medica del empleado. La informaci&oacute;n puede ser ofrecida por el empleado, siempre y cuando la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica sea necesaria para determinar la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. La E.E.O.C. tambi&eacute;n ha declarado que la A.D.A. permite que el empleador y el sindicato compartan informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica necesaria para el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; funci&oacute;n puede tener el dirigente obrero al asitir en la implementaci&oacute;n de la A.D.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El dirigente obrero o agente empresarial es la persona del sindicato que puede ser contactada por cada uno de los miembros, al cual estos pueden traer sus problemas y agravios, del cual los miembros reciben informaci&oacute;n y que tiene acceso a los empleados durante el d&iacute;a laboral. El sindicato puede diseminar informaci&oacute;n vital sobre la A.D.A entre sus miembros a trav&eacute;s del dirigente obrero o agente empresarial , como puede ser la ilegalidad de la discriminaci&oacute;n contra individuos con deshabilidades y como funciona el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  </div>  <h2>Conclusi&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Estas medidas proactivas pueden ayudar tanto al empleador como al sindicato en cuanto a sus obligaciones bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. para proveer acomodaciones razonables, y bajo las regulaciones de la N.L.R.A. para negociar cuando sea necesario sobre acomodaciones razonables que causan cambios en los t&eacute;rminos y condiciones del empleo. M&aacute;s que todo, estas medidas proactivas promover&aacute;n ambientes de trabajo positivos y productivos para los empleadores y los sindicatos y har&aacute;n avanzar el objetivo de la A.D.A., que es la inclusi&oacute;n y apreciaci&oacute;n de las personas con deshabilidades en el lugar de trabajo y en la sociedad.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Laurie M.

La ADA define el t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; como una limitaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica o mental que afecta de forma considerable una actividad principal en la vida de la persona, as&iacute; como tener un antecedente de padecer tal limitaci&oacute;n, o asumir que esta persona padece de tal limitaci&oacute;. Muchos casos legales han sido rechazados por el hecho de que la persona realmente no tiene la deshabilidad como es definida por la ADA.</p>  <p>Cuando un empleador recibe una solicitud para una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable u otra medida requerida por la ley ADA, es importante poder establecer el hecho de que esta persona tiene una deshabilidad definida bajo esta ley. Muchas veces la deshabilidad puede ser obvia. Mientras en otras situaciones el cubrimiento de la deshabilidad bajo la ADA no es tan claro. En el caso en que la deshabilidad no sea lo suficientemente evidente por su severidad o duraci&oacute;n para ser considerada como una deshabilidad en t&eacute;rminos de la ADA, el empleador con buenas pr&aacute;cticas de administraci&oacute;n de personal, puede ir directamente al tema de la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Si el empleador puede proveer la solicitud de la persona y permitirle solicitar un nuevo cargo o ser mantenido en el mismo cargo sin que &eacute;sto ocasione un costo excesivo o interrupciones a la empresa, esta decisi&oacute;n podr&iacute;a ser considerada como una pr&aacute;ctica administrativa inteligente a pesar de que sea o no una obligaci&oacute;n bajo la ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es una deshabilidad en t&eacute;rminos de la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>En general, ser&aacute; substancialmente evidente el hecho de que una persona tenga una deshabilidad en t&eacute;rminos de la ADA, siempre y cuando la deshabilidad sea obvia, se tenga un diagn&oacute;stico documentado y exista una limitaci&oacute;n considerable en una o m&aacute;s actividades principales de la vida de la persona. Una &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; puede ser fisiol&oacute;gica, mental o psicol&oacute;gica. La ADA define la &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; en t&eacute;rminos generales como cualquier desorden o condici&oacute;n fisiol&oacute;gica, desfiguraci&oacute;n cosm&eacute;tica o un da&ntilde;o anat&oacute;mico que afecta uno o m&aacute;s de los sistemas m&uacute;ltiples del cuerpo, incluyendo los &oacute;rganos espec&iacute;ficos de los sentidos, los sistemas neurol&oacute;gico, m&uacute;sculo-esquel&eacute;tico, respiratorio, cardiovascular, reproductivo, digestivo, genitourinario, sangu&iacute;neo o linf&aacute;tico, de la piel y el sistema endocrinol&oacute;gico. Adem&aacute;s, la ADA define la &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; como cualquier desorden mental o psicol&oacute;gico, por ejemplo: retraso mental, s&iacute;ndrome de la alteraci&oacute;n org&aacute;nica del cerebro, enfermedad mental o emocional, y las limitaciones espec&iacute;ficas en el aprendizaje. Ni las normas, ni las regulaciones que interpretan y ponen en pr&aacute;ctica la ADA tienden a incluir todos los des&oacute;rdenes o condiciones. Tener una lista con la totalidad de estos des&oacute;rdenes ser&iacute;a pr&aacute;cticamente imposible, debido al gran n&uacute;mero y variedad de posibles deshabilidades.</p>  <p>La definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad no incluye las caracter&iacute;sticas f&iacute;sicas, (por ejemplo, ser zurdo o diferir en relaci&oacute;n a la estatura o el peso normal), las caracter&iacute;sticas de la personalidad (por ejemplo, ser temperamental), el embarazo o las desventajas de tipo cultural o econ&oacute;mico. Tambi&eacute;n existen algunas exclusiones reconocidas por la ley en relaci&oacute;n a la definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad, como ciertas personas que usan drogas ilegales cuando el empleador toma medidas para prevenir el uso de estas sustancias en el lugar de trabajo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es una actividad principal de la vida diaria?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>La Comisi&oacute;n para la Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo de los EE.UU.

La evaluaci&oacute;n de las decisiones jur&iacute;dicas indica que s&oacute;lo porque la deshabilidad afecta una actividad principal, no quiere decir que &eacute;sta va a cumplir con los requisitos para ser considerada bajo la categor&iacute;a de &ldquo;una limitaci&oacute;n considerable.&rdquo; La limitaci&oacute;n debe ser significativa. Adem&aacute;s, algunos juzgados han evaluado las actividades que la persona puede desempe&ntilde;ar para determinar si ella o &eacute;l esta realmente limitado de forma considerable. Por ejemplo, un juzgado encontr&oacute; que el demandante no tenia una limitaci&oacute;n considerable en cuanto a la habilidad de caminar, sosteniendo que el demandante pod&iacute;a mantener un ritmo de vida activo, pod&iacute;a ir de cacer&iacute;a, de pesca, y pod&iacute;a jugar 18 hoyos de golf al igual que lo hace cualquier otra persona, marchar a doble tiempo y correr una milla y media en 15 minutos.<sup>5</sup></p>  <p>En t&eacute;rmino de la duraci&oacute;n, un impedimento de corto plazo sin un efecto permanente a largo plazo, generalmente no se determina como una &ldquo;limitaci&oacute;n considerable.&rdquo; Lo dif&iacute;cil es definir el t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;a corto plazo&rdquo;. La EEOC ha declarado que mientras estos casos se deben decidir individualmente, una limitaci&oacute;n por pocos d&iacute;as o una semana generalmente se considerar&iacute;a a corto plazo. (Un ejemplo proveniente de un manual sobre el cumplimiento de las normas de la EEOC, encontr&oacute; que una deshabilidad por seis semanas se considerar&iacute;a como de corto plazo.) Varios tribunales han encontrado que las condiciones con duraci&oacute;n entre dos semanas y tres meses y medio son consideradas como de corto plazo y no como una deshabilidad. Otros juzgados han encontrado que aquellas condiciones que duran entre siete y diez meses, (seis meses de restricci&oacute;n severa seguidos por cuatro de restricci&oacute;n moderada) no se consideran deshabilidades ya que eran respectivamente muy cortas o dudaron s&oacute;lo por un tiempo <sup>6</sup>. Sin embargo, la EEOC y varios tribunales han asumido la posici&oacute;n que si el impedimento dura al menos varios meses, &eacute;ste puede ser determinado como una limitaci&oacute;n considerable. La definici&oacute;n com&uacute;n del t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;varios&rdquo; significa una cantidad de dos o tres pero no muchos m&aacute;s .<sup>7</sup> La posici&oacute;n de la EEOC sobre impedimento es que &eacute;ste no tiene que ser permanente para ser considerado como una deshabilidad.</p>  <p>Frecuentemente puede ser imposible predecir la duraci&oacute;n exacta de una condici&oacute;n de salud. La posici&oacute;n de la EEOC es que si una condici&oacute;n es grave, con duraci&oacute;n indefinida o desconocida, &eacute;sta puede considerarse como una deshabilidad. Las condiciones cr&oacute;nicas de salud que son extremadamente limitantes cuando los s&iacute;ntomas se activan pueden tambi&eacute;n ser consideradas como deshabilidades. Esto incluir&iacute;a, por ejemplo, las condiciones que se presentan epis&oacute;dicamente como el desorden bipolar. Un impedimento temporal que puede tener efectos permanentes o residuales a largo plazo, tales como una contusi&oacute;n cerebral que cause un da&ntilde;o permanente al cerebro se puede considerar tambi&eacute;n como una deshabilidad.</p>  <p>En resumen, un impedimento o los efectos que &eacute;ste conlleva deben ser suficientemente graves y a largo plazo (o al menos de varios meses) para considerarse como una deshabilidad, pero no debe ser de car&aacute;cter permanente.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo</i>, una persona tiene una restricci&oacute;n de no alzar objetos de m&aacute;s de 10 libras debido a una lesi&oacute;n de la espalda. Generalmente ella se considerar&iacute;a como sustancialmente limitada en la actividad principal de poder alzar objetos ya que la mayor&iacute;a de personas pueden alzar objetos de este peso.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo</i>, una persona tiene una restricci&oacute;n de no alzar objetos de m&aacute;s de 35 libras por un da&ntilde;o en su espalda. Generalmente esta persona no se considerar&iacute;a con una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial en la actividad principal de la capacidad de poder alzar objetos, ya que &eacute;sto no constituye una restricci&oacute;n sustancial en la habilidad de alzar, trabajar o tomar parte en otras actividades principales de su vida cotidiana, si se compara con la habilidad que tendr&iacute;a una persona promedio.</p>  hr width=100%&gt;  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\">  <p><sup>5</sup>Lamb Vs.Corporaci&oacute;n de Carb&oacute;n del Condado de Bell, 1999 US APP LEXIS 22201 (Sexto Cir. 1999) (sin publicar)</p>  <p><sup>6</sup> Ver: Resolviendo Preguntas de la ADA en el Lugar de Trabajo, Cap&iacute;tulo 1.</p>  <p><sup>7</sup> Diccionario del Patrimonio Americano (Tercera Edici&oacute;n. 1996)</p>  </div>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; sucede con las medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>La posici&oacute;n inicial de las regulaciones de la EEOC y seguida por muchos juzgados, indic&oacute; que las medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n como los medicamentos o aparatos prost&eacute;ticos no deben ser tenidos en cuenta para considerar si el impedimento de una persona alcanza el nivel de deshabilidad. La Corte Suprema de Justicia, en una serie de tres fallos en 1999, cambi&oacute; por completo esta posici&oacute;n.</p>  <p>En cada uno de estos casos el tema primordial ante la Suprema Corte era si los demandantes calificaban o no como personas con deshabilidades.

La Suprema Corte decidi&oacute; que ninguno de ellos calificar&iacute;an como una persona con deshabilidad si se considera que ellos utilizan medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n como anteojos, medicamentos, o comportamientos compensatorios.

La EEOC dio instrucciones a sus investigadores para que se concentraran en el hecho de si la medida o comportamiento controla o no total o parcialmente los s&iacute;ntomas o limitaciones del impedimento.</p>  <p>Dichas instrucciones indican que las siguientes actividades principales de la vida pueden ser impactadas considerablemente por el uso de ciertas medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n:</p>  <p>*Pensar, concentrarse, y otras funciones cognoscitivas pueden ser afectadas por los efectos secundarios de ciertos medicamentos;</p>  <p>*caminar, pararse y alzar objetos pueden estar limitados de forma sustancial a&uacute;n con el uso de piernas, pie o mano prost&eacute;ticas;</p>  <p>*Ansiedad de comer constantemente o nausea severa pueden ser causadas por ciertos medicamentos, o puede requerir un horario r&iacute;gido de comidas;</p>  <p>*Cuidar de si mismo&ndash;&ndash;por ejemplo, el controlar la diabetes requiere cambios o interrupciones en las actividades diarias;</p>  <p>*La actividad de dormir se puede ver afectada por ciertos medicamentos que pueden causar somnolencia o insomnio;</p>  <p>*llevar a cabo ciertas labores manuales se pueden ver afectadas por la alteraci&oacute;n de las habilidades motoras finas debido a ciertos medicamentos;</p>  <p>l*a funci&oacute;n reproductiva se puede ver afectada por ciertos medicamentos utilizados para controlar las convulsiones o enfermedades psiqui&aacute;tricas que pueden causar defectos cong&eacute;nitos, limitando de forma sustancial esta funci&oacute;n y</p>  <p>*finalmente la habilidad de trabajar se ver&aacute; afectada por la alteraci&oacute;n en cualquiera de estas actividades.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha determinado que las medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n pueden ser no tan efectivas en todos los casos o pueden perder efectividad con el tiempo (por ejemplo, cuando una persona tiene mucho estr&eacute;s o se expone a condiciones clim&aacute;ticas inciertas). Las instrucciones de la EEOC tambi&eacute;n sugieren a los investigadores de este campo a concentrarse en el hecho de que si una medida de atenuaci&oacute;n tiene alg&uacute;n efecto secundario por si sola, o en combinaci&oacute;n con otra medida de atenuaci&oacute;n, que pueda limitar de forma sustancial una actividad principal de la vida.</p>  <p>Tenga en cuenta que las medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n se deben considerar en las tres definiciones de deshabilidad bajo la ley ADA.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo</i>, Una persona tiene diabetes y depende de la insulina para controlar esta condici&oacute;n. Sin embargo, debe comer ciertos tipos y cantidades de comida para minimizar las fluctuaciones de los niveles del az&uacute;car en la sangre. Adem&aacute;s, cuando el nivel del az&uacute;car baja, la persona debe parar lo que esta haciendo y encontrar el tipo de comida que le reestablecer&aacute; el nivel del az&uacute;car a un nivel normal. Si no hace esto la persona va a tener episodios que lo limitaran tales como: mareos, debilidad y p&eacute;rdida de la concentraci&oacute;n. Esta persona se puede considerar que tiene una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial en la actividad principal de comer.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha declarado que algunas condiciones, como por ejemplo problemas graves de la espalda y la mayor&iacute;a de tipos de enfermedades del coraz&oacute;n y el c&aacute;ncer, pueden producir una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial de una actividad principal en la vida de la persona, por tal motivo se deben prevenir o reducir los factores o actividades que tiendan agravar dicha condici&oacute;n o generar la repetici&oacute;n de un episodio. Por ejemplo, personas con problemas serios de espalda pueden estar f&iacute;sicamente en condici&oacute;n de llevar a cabo una actividad pero no lo pueden hacer porque hacerla causar&iacute;a que su condici&oacute;n empeorara. La mayor&iacute;a de juzgados tambi&eacute;n han decidido que el c&aacute;ncer se considera como una deshabilidad cubierta bajo la ADA, ya sea porque el c&aacute;ncer limita una actividad principal o porque existe constancia de padecer tal condici&oacute;n . La EEOC ha determinado que el embarazo no se considerara como una deshabilidad, aunque las complicaciones relacionadas con el embarazo, como la hipertensi&oacute;n que obliga al descanso en cama a largo plazo, puede ser una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial de una actividad principal de la vida.</p>  </div>  <h2>Limitaci&oacute;n en la actividad de trabajar.</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Trabajar es probablemente la m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de las actividades principales de la vida para analizar y las instrucciones de la EEOC determinan que sus investigaciones deben dirigirse inicialmente a determinar si un impedimento limita de forma sustancial una actividad principal aparte de la de trabajar. Si no existe una limitaci&oacute;n considerable en alguna otra actividad principal, la &uacute;ltima parte del an&aacute;lisis debe determinar si la persona est&aacute; limitada considerablemente en la actividad principal de trabajar.</p>  <p>Una persona est&aacute; limitada considerablemente en la actividad principal de trabajar, si ella/&eacute;l tiene muchas restricciones para desempe&ntilde;arse en una clase espec&iacute;fica de empleo o un rango de empleos en varias clases de trabajo, en comparaci&oacute;n con una persona promedio que tenga el entrenamiento, habilidad t&eacute;cnica, y destrezas. El &aacute;rea geogr&aacute;fica a la que la persona tiene acceso razonable es considerado, as&iacute; como el n&uacute;mero de empleos que requieren habilidades y destrezas similares (de la misma clase) y habilidades y destrezas diferentes (de gran amplitud.) El hecho de no poder desempe&ntilde;ar una funci&oacute;n espec&iacute;fica de un puesto no constituye una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial en la actividad principal de trabajar.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha determinado que una clase de empleos puede incluir una categor&iacute;a como un empleo de trabajo pesado (por ejemplo, un empleado con problemas de la espalda que le impide levantar objetos pesados), puestos que requieren el uso de computadoras, (por ejemplo una persona con limitaciones en la vista que le impide leer el texto en una pantalla de computadora), o los puestos secretariales.</p>  <p>La EEOC tambi&eacute;n ha suministrado ejemplos de cuando la persona esta limitada en el desempe&ntilde;o de una &ldquo;rangos de empleos&rdquo;. Estos incluyen la persona que no puede trabajar en edificios elevados debido a sus alergias, y alguien con una limitaci&oacute;n auditiva que no puede trabajar en un medio ambiente ruidoso como taller de carpinter&iacute;a, garaje de reparaci&oacute;n de autom&oacute;viles, trabajo en demoliciones y trabajo en mantenimiento de terrenos del aeropuerto.</p>  <p>Ha habido mucha litigaci&oacute;n en este tema <sup>12</sup>. Por ejemplo, un tribunal evalu&oacute; si la tendinitis de un empleado que le imped&iacute;a trabajar en puestos que requer&iacute;an movimientos repetitivos con las manos y lo limitaba sustancialmente en el desempe&ntilde;o de una clase amplia de cargos. La corte encontr&oacute; que las restricciones imped&iacute;an que la persona trabajara en una gran variedad de puestos en el &aacute;rea metropolitana, incluyendo cualquier puesto en una l&iacute;nea de ensamblaje que requer&iacute;a movimientos repetitivos <sup>13</sup>. En otro caso la Corte consider&oacute; si un trabajador de la construcci&oacute;n especializado en asegurar los techos, quien se hab&iacute;a lastimado el hombro, estaba limitado considerablemente para trabajar si no pod&oacute;a hacer trabajo manual sobre su cabeza, levantar objetos pesados, o hacer movimientos necesarios para empujar o jalar objetos hacia y lejos de su cuerpo. La corte estableci&oacute; que esta lesi&oacute;n podr&iacute;a considerarse como una limitaci&oacute;n sustancial para poder trabajar, porque se puede aplicar a una gran diversidad de puestos incluyendo cualquier cargo en una mina de carb&oacute;n o en puestos relacionados, como en la construcci&oacute;n .<sup>14</sup></p>  <p>Otro juzgado encontr&oacute; &lsquo;que la diabetes (sin el uso de la insulina) le causaba a cierta persona tal grado de irritabilidad que no pod&iacute;a llevarse bien con los dem&aacute;s empleados y otras personas, lo cual lo limitaba considerablemente en la actividad de trabajar. La Corte opin&oacute; que la habilidad de llevarse bien con sus colegas y clientes es necesaria en la mayor&iacute;a de puestos .<sup>15</sup></p>  <p>Los juzgados han encontrado que la inhabilidad de trabajar bajo el mando de cierto supervisor<sup>16</sup> o en un edificio en particular<sup>17</sup> no implica que dicho individuo no pueda desempe&ntilde;arse una clase de puestos o un rango de puestos en varias clases de trabajos.</p>  <p>Otro punto importante es que a veces los juzgados parecen concentrarse en cuales son los trabajos que la persona a&uacute;n puede desempe&ntilde;ar, en lugar de enfocarse en cu&aacute;n deshabilitada est&aacute; la persona para trabajar, lo cual no es parte del an&aacute;lisis de la EEOC. Por ejemplo, en cierto caso la Suprema corte decidi&oacute; que el demandante no estaba limitado sustancialmente para trabajar, ya que exist&iacute;an muchos otros puestos que &eacute;ste pod&iacute;a desempe&ntilde;ar, incluyendo puestos como mec&aacute;nico que no requieren certificaci&oacute;n de la DOT <sup>18</sup>.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\">  <p><sup>12</sup>Ver: Resolviendo Preguntas de la ADA en el Lugar de Trabajo, Cap&iacute;tulo 1.</p>  <p><sup>13</sup>Depaoli Vs.

Tenga en cuenta que una persona con un antecedente de deshabilidad bajo otras leyes o regulaciones pueden no ser necesariamente considerada una persona con un antecedente de deshabilidad bajo la ADA. Por ejemplo, un fallo a favor sobre la existencia de una deshabilidad de acuerdo a la ley de compensaci&oacute;n laboral no necesariamente equivale a una deshabilidad reconocida por la ADA.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha determinado que tambi&eacute;n se deben considerar las medidas de atenuaci&oacute;n, una persona sin una deshabilidad actual estar&iacute;a incluida en la segunda parte de la definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad bas&aacute;ndose en su condici&oacute;n antes del uso de la medicina, o de empezar a usar otra medida de atenuaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo</i>, hace varios a&ntilde;os, una persona sufri&oacute; de un tipo severo de depresi&oacute;n que le imped&iacute;a desempe&ntilde;arse en las actividades de su vida cotidiana. Debido a su condici&oacute;n la persona requiri&oacute; ser hospitalizada por un mes y recibir un a&ntilde;o de terapia como paciente externo, incluyendo psicoterapia y medicamentos.

La tercera parte de la definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad puede aplicarse en cualquiera de las siguientes tres situaciones.</p>  <p><b>1)</b> Una persona puede tener un impedimento que no la limita sustancialmente, pero es tratada por el empleador como si lo fuera. Por ejemplo, una persona con hipertensi&oacute;n arterial controlada puede no tener restricciones f&iacute;sicas. Si un empleador se reh&uacute;sa a asignarle a &eacute;l o ella un trabajo f&iacute;sico de cualquier tipo debido a su condici&oacute;n, el empleador estar&iacute;a considerando a esta persona como deshabilitada.</p>  <p><b>2)</b> Una persona puede tener un impedimento que es s&oacute;lo f&iacute;sicamente limitante debido a la actitud de otros. Por ejemplo, un empleado tiene muchas cicatrices faciales a ra&iacute;z de un accidente. El empleador se reh&uacute;sa a colocar a esta persona en un puesto de servicio al clientes por temor a la reacci&oacute;n del p&uacute;blico, a&uacute;n cuando ella / &eacute;l esta capacitado(a) desempe&ntilde;ar dicho cargo. Este impedimento s&oacute;lo se considera sustancialmente limitante debido a las reacciones negativas de otros.</p>  <p><b>3)</b> Un empleador cree err&oacute;neamente que un salvavidas tiene una condici&oacute;n cardiaca grave y lo remueve de su cargo. En realidad, este salvavidas no ten&iacute;a la condici&oacute;n cardiaca. En este caso el empleador estar&iacute;a considerando a esta persona con un impedimento que lo limita de forma sustancial.</p>  <p>La EEOC ha declarado que el hecho de que el empleador tenga conocimiento acerca de un impedimento real (o percibido) es muy importante en los casos en que se &ldquo;asume que&rdquo; una persona tiene una deshabilidad. Algunos juzgados tambi&eacute;n han adoptado esta posici&oacute;n. Por ejemplo, un juzgado rechazo la demanda de un empleado bajo el criterio &ldquo;se asume que tiene una limitaci&oacute;n&rdquo;, porque el empleado no proporcion&oacute; evidencia para demostrar que los supervisores y administradores sab&iacute;an que ella hab&iacute;a sido diagnosticada con una deshabilidad mental <sup>19</sup>. Por otra parte, el hecho que un empleador sepa sobre el impedimento de un empleado, no es evidencia suficiente para demostrar que el empleador considera al empleado como deshabilitado, o que esta percepci&oacute;n perjudica negativamente al empleado <sup>20</sup>.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\">  <p><sup>19</sup>Wedd Vs.

Para estar cubierto bajo es parte de la definici&oacute;n de deshabilidad, el individuo tiene que demostrar que el empleador lo percibe con un impedimento que lo limita sustancialmente para desempe&ntilde;ar un trabajo o una serie de trabajos (No s&oacute;lo un cargo o un tipo limitado de cargos). La EEOC ha tomado la posici&oacute;n que va a analizar estos casos al establecer el criterio que el empleador ha utilizado para descalificar a la persona y determinar si el criterio se aplica a un puesto espec&iacute;fico o a una clase o multitud de empleos. Tal criterio puede incluir lo siguiente:</p>  <p>*Est&aacute;ndares de visi&oacute;n y audici&oacute;n *Habilidad de alzar cierto peso *Trabajar a ciertos niveles de altitud *Trabajar con ciertas herramientas, aparatos o substancias *Habilidad para trabajar bajo situaciones con mucho estr&eacute;s.</p>  <p>Note que el criterio no tiene que ser un requisito formal especificado en la descripci&oacute;n del puesto o en otro sitio, pero es sin embargo la raz&oacute;n por la cual el empleador piensa que la persona no puede llevar a cabo las funciones del puesto. La EEOC ha declarado que un empleador es responsable con respecto a la secci&oacute;n de &ldquo;se asume que se tiene una limitaci&oacute;n&rdquo; bajo la ADA, s&oacute;lo si considera que el impedimento limita o restringe a la persona en reunir los requisitos o criterio de calificaci&oacute;n. Esta posici&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n se refleja en las decisiones jur&iacute;dicas.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo</i>, en un caso el juzgado determin&oacute; que el empleador pensaba que el empleado no pod&iacute;a manejar el nivel de estr&eacute;s o el n&uacute;mero de horas de trabajo de un puesto como supervisor, luego de someterse a una operaci&oacute;n para extirparle un tumor cerebral, siendo transferido a un cargo inferior.

Los amigos, miembros de la familia, supervisores, consejeros de rehabilitaci&oacute;n, y los terapeutas ocupacionales o los fisioterapeutas pueden tener conocimiento directo sobre las restricciones de la persona.

La ADA cubre todos los aspectos de la participaci&oacute;n en la sociedad/ empleo, las acomodaciones p&amp;#250licas, el transporte y las telecomunicaciones.

La ADA tambi&eacute;n requiere que los empleadores ofrezcan acomodaciones razonables necesarias para prevenir la discriminaci&oacute;n. Los empleadores, profesionales de recursos humanos y los representantes de los sindicatos laborales deben estar familiarizados con la ADA para responder apropiadamente a las solicitudes de acomodaciones hechas por los empleados con deshabilidades y de esta manera garantizar el cumplimiento de los requisitos de la ADA.

La definici&oacute;n del &ldquo;empleador&rdquo; incluye a personas que act&uacute;an como representantes del empleador, como los administradores, supervisores, capataces, u otros que act&uacute;en en nombre del empleador como las agencias de investigaci&oacute;n encargadas de revisar la experiencia profesional y los antecedentes laborales de los solicitantes.

Los empleadores deben estar muy atentos a posibles asuntos relacionados con las regulaciones de la ADA en las &aacute;reas de: contrataci&oacute;n, ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos de pre-empleo, las lesiones en el lugar de trabajo, la confidencialidad de la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica y de ofrecer acomodaciones razonables.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;La ADA protege autom&aacute;ticamente a todo trabajador que se haya lastimado?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: No. El hecho de que empleado lesionado est&eacute; protegido bajo las normas de la ADA depender&aacute; de si esta persona re&uacute;ne las caracter&iacute;sticas requeridas por la definici&oacute;n legal de &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; bajo la ADA. El t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;deshabilidad&rdquo; bajo las normas de la ADA se define como una limitaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica o mental que afecta de forma considerable una actividad principal en la vida de la persona, as&iacute; como tener un antecedente de padecer tal limitaci&oacute;n, o asumir que esta persona padece de tal limitaci&oacute;n.

El antecedente debe estar relacionado a una deshabilidad que haya limitado de forma considerable una o mas de las actividades principales de la vida diaria.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Cu&amp;#225ndo se considera un individuo lesionado como deshabilitado bajo la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: Bajo la definici&oacute;n &ldquo;Considerado como&rdquo; de la ADA un empleado lesionado en el trabajo se asume que tiene una deshabilidad si:</p>  <p>1. &eacute;l / ella tiene un impedimento que no limita una actividad principal, pero el empleador la/lo trata como si este impedimento fuera considerablemente limitante;</p>  <p>2. Tiene un impedimento que limita de forma considerable una actividad principal debido a las actitudes de otros en cuanto a la deshabilidad;</p>  <p>3. No tiene un impedimento pero lo tratan como si &eacute;l/ella tuviera un impedimento que le limita de forma considerable.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo 1</i>: Durante el traslado de una oficina un empleado sufre un lesi&oacute;n f&iacute;sica ocupacional que como consecuencia afecta temporalmente su espalda y &eacute;ste no puede levantar objetos pesados. El empleador considera que este empleado no puede ni siquiera levantar objetos livianos y se reh&uacute;sa a dejarlo reintegrarse a su puesto, a&uacute;n cuando este es capaz de cumplir con todas las responsabilidades del cargo, que tan solo requiere poder levantar objetos livianos comunes y corrientes, como un libro o un paquete peque&ntilde;o de papel. Esta persona se clasificar&iacute;a como deshabilitada bajo la ADA.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo 2</i>: Una empleada se quema seriamente la cara en un incendio en el laboratorio donde trabaja causado por un accidente. Esta persona es completamente capaz de regresar a desempe&ntilde;ar sus funciones como cient&iacute;fica. Sin embargo, el empleador se rehusa a dejarla volver a su puesto por temor a reacciones negativas de otros empleados o clientes. El empleador considera que ella tiene un impedimento que la limita de forma considerable en la actividad principal de interactuar con otros en el lugar de trabajo. Esta empleada tendr&iacute;a una deshabilidad bajo las normas definidas por la ADA.</p>  <p><i>Ejemplo 3</i>: Una persona se ha recuperado completamente de una lesi&oacute;n a su espalda. &Eacute;l solicita un nuevo cargo pero el empleador no lo contrata porque asume que se volver&aacute; a lesionar la espalda gravemente si regresa a hacer trabajo pesado. El empleador asume que este solicitante esta descalificado para aquellos cargos que requieren trabajo pesado y consecuentemente lo considera limitado en la actividad principal de poder trabajar.</p>  <p>A&uacute;n cuando un empleado haya recibido beneficios de compensaci&oacute;n laboral o se le haya asignado a un nivel de salario elevado por compensaci&oacute;n sobre deshabilidad, es necesario determinar en cada caso si la persona es un individuo con una deshabilidad bajo la ADA.</p>  <p>El otro requisito importante para estar cubierto por la ADA es que la persona tiene que estar calificada para el cargo. Un empleado o solicitante lesionado se considera calificado si &eacute;l / ella cumple con los requisitos de educaci&oacute;n, experiencia y las destrezas necesarias para desempe&ntilde;ar el cargo, y puede cumplir con las funciones esenciales del trabajo, con o sin acomodaciones razonables.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Puede la ADA limitar que un empleador averig&uuml;e sobre los antecedentes de compensaci&oacute;n Laboral de un empleado o solicitante?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: S&iacute;. La ADA limita cuando el empleador puede preguntarle al empleado sobre demandas anteriores por compensaci&oacute;n laboral. Durante la etapa anterior a la oferta de trabajo el empleador no puede preguntarle al solicitante sobre la deshabilidad, o hacer preguntas que puedan referirse a la deshabilidad, incluyendo aquellas sobre su historial de compensaci&oacute;n laboral. En esta etapa el empleador tampoco puede pedir informaci&oacute;n sobre compensaci&oacute;n laboral a terceras partes como a empleadores previos, a oficinas estatales de compensaci&oacute;n laboral, o servicios que ofrecen informaci&oacute;n sobre compensaci&oacute;n laboral. En la etapa siguiente a la oferta del puesto pero antes de haber empezado a trabajar, un empleador si puede hacer preguntas relacionadas con la deshabilidad, incluyendo preguntas sobre compensaci&oacute;n laboral y puede requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos, siempre y cuando estos requerimientos apliquen a todos los individuos por igual.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Cu&aacute;les son los requisitos de la ADA con respecto a los ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos antes de la oferta de empleo y las preguntas sobre deshabilidades, incluyendo aquellas sobre compensaci&oacute;n laboral?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: Es ilegal que un empleador realice indagaciones o preguntas relacionadas con la deshabilidad, o requiera un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico al aplicante antes de hacerle una oferta de trabajo. Como se mencion&oacute; anteriormente &eacute;sto incluye las preguntas sobre los antecedentes de compensaci&oacute;n laboral.</p>  <p>Sin embargo, luego de que se haya hecho una oferta condicional de empleo, pero antes de haber empezado a trabajar, el empleador puede preguntar sobre los antecedentes m&eacute;dicos o de compensaci&oacute;n laboral o requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos para obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre la existencia o causa de ciertos lesiones ocupacionales anteriores del solicitante, siempre y cuando estas preguntas o ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos sean requeridos a todo solicitante en la misma categor&iacute;a de trabajo. Una vez que el empleador ha obtenido informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica b&aacute;sica acerca de todos los empleados que est&aacute;n iniciando su empleo en la misma categor&iacute;a de trabajo, el empleador puede pedirle a ciertos individuos que se hagan ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos de seguimiento y contesten otras preguntas, si estos ex&aacute;menes y preguntas est&aacute;n relacionados con la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica obtenida anteriormente.</p>  <p>En caso de que el empleador niegue la oferta de empleo porque el examen m&eacute;dico demuestra que la persona no satisface ciertos criterios de calificaci&oacute;n, incluyendo requisitos con respecto a la seguridad, visi&oacute;n, o audici&oacute;n, o que repruebe ciertos ex&aacute;menes relacionados con el puesto, el empleador debe demostrar lo siguiente:</p>  <p>* El criterio de exclusi&oacute;n no descarta a la persona bas&aacute;ndose en la deshabilidad o;</p>  <p>* El criterio de exclusi&oacute;n est&aacute; relacionado con el puesto de trabajo y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa, y no existe una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que permita a una persona con una deshabilidad cumplir con las funciones esenciales del puesto.</p>  <p>La EEOC determina que se debe demostrar que el solicitante se considera un &ldquo;riesgo directo&rdquo; cuando no cumple con los criterios de seguridad requeridos para el cargo y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  </div>  <h2>P&amp;#58 &iquest;Qu&eacute; sucede si el empleador piensa que la deshabilidad o lesi&oacute;n ocupacional anterior de la persona puede aumentar los costos de compensaci&oacute;n laboral?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: Un empleador no puede negarse a emplear a una persona con una deshabilidad solo porque asume que la deshabilidad va a aumentar el riesgo de que &eacute;sta persona se lastime en el lugar de trabajo y aumente los costos de compensaci&oacute;n laboral. De igual manera, un empleador no puede negarse a contratar a una persona con una deshabilidad que anteriormente haya sufrido una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional, basado en apreciaciones generalizadas o en estereotipos. Excluir a trabajadores con deshabilidades debido a su deshabilidad o por una lesi&oacute;n previa en el lugar de trabajo se considera como discriminaci&oacute;n por deshabilidad, a menos que el empleador pueda establecer un riesgo directo.</p>  <p>Un empleador puede negarse a contratar a una persona para un cargo espec&iacute;fico s&oacute;lo si esta persona se considera como un riesgo directo en dicho cargo. El t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;riesgo directo&rdquo; significa un peligro considerable a la salud o seguridad de otras personas en el lugar de trabajo que no puede ser eliminado o reducido a trav&eacute;s de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Este es un requisito dif&iacute;cil de cumplir y debe estar basado en una investigaci&oacute;n real e individualizada, tomando en cuenta las circunstancias espec&iacute;ficas del individuo con la deshabilidad y del cargo en cuesti&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Por <i>ejemplo</i>, un empleado sufre de un desorden de tensi&oacute;n post-traum&aacute;tica, que le caus&oacute; la p&oacute;rdida de la concentraci&oacute;n y la memoria. El solicita un puesto como chofer de cami&oacute;n lleno de gasolina de alta inflamabilidad. El empleador decide que esta persona presenta un riesgo directo al sitio de trabajo y a la salud y seguridad del p&uacute;blico y que no califica para el puesto de conductor del cami&oacute;n, considerado &eacute;ste como un &ldquo;trabajo de alto riesgo&rdquo; , con o sin una acomodaci&oacute;n. Esto no infringir&iacute;a contra las normas de la ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;C&oacute;mo se consideran los ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos y las preguntas sobre deshabilidad cuando la persona se ha lesionado o quiere volver a trabajar?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: La ADA permite que el empleador haga preguntas relacionadas con deshabilidad o que requiera un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico cuando el empleado sufra una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional en el lugar de trabajo o quiere regresar a trabajar despu&eacute;s de haberse lesionado, siempre y cuando las preguntas o ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos est&eacute;n directamente relacionados con el puesto y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa. Este requisito se aplica si el empleador considera de forma razonable que esta lesi&oacute;n ocupacional va a impedir que el empleado cumpla con las funciones esenciales del cargo o aumente las circunstancias espec&iacute;ficas de riesgo directo. Las preguntas o ex&aacute;menes no deben abarcar m&aacute;s que lo relacionado con la lesi&oacute;n espec&iacute;fica y su efecto sobre la habilidad del empleado para desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del cargo, con o sin el uso de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, o trabajar sin ser considerado como un riesgo directo.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Tiene la ADA alg&uacute;n impacto en c&oacute;mo un empleador determina su responsabilidad con respecto a la compensaci&oacute;n laboral?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: La ADA no proh&iacute;be que un empleador haga preguntas relacionadas con deshabilidad o requiera ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos a aquellos empleados que est&aacute;n solicitando compensaci&oacute;n laboral, mientras estas sean necesarias para determinar su responsabilidad con relaci&oacute;n a la compensaci&oacute;n. Las preguntas y ex&aacute;menes deben estar de acuerdo con el prop&oacute;sito de las leyes estatales para determinar la elegibilidad del empleado para poder recibir estas prestaciones. Las preguntas y ex&aacute;menes deben limitarse a la lesi&oacute;n ocupacional espec&iacute;fica y no pueden ser requeridas con mayor frecuencia de lo necesario para determinar la elegibilidad inicial o para recibir las prestaciones de compensaci&oacute;n laboral.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Con qui&eacute;n se pueden compartir los expedientes m&eacute;dicos?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: La informaci&oacute;n obtenida a trav&eacute;s de ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos autorizados y de preguntas sobre deshabilidad se consideran como &ldquo;informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica confidencial&rdquo; y deber&aacute; ser recopilada y organizada en formularios separados y en archivos m&eacute;dicos separados.

La determinaci&oacute;n bajo la ley de compensaci&oacute;n laboral de si un empleado es considerado como &ldquo;permanente o totalmente deshabilitado&rdquo; no elimina la reincorporaci&oacute;n de esta persona a su puesto trabajo bajo las regulaciones de empleo de la ADA. Puede ser, sin embargo, que el proveer evidencia relevante acerca de si la persona puede o no desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del cargo, con o sin acomodaciones razonables, y sin ser considerada como un riesgo directo, sea necesario para justificar el por qu&eacute; se le niega la reintegraci&oacute;n al trabajo.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Qui&eacute;n toma la decisi&oacute;n de la reincorporaci&oacute;n del empleado al trabajo?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: El empleador es, en &uacute;ltima instancia, la persona responsable de decidir si el empleado con una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional puede regresar a trabajar. El empleador puede encontrar muy &uacute;til la informaci&oacute;n obtenida de un consejero de rehabilitaci&oacute;n, un m&eacute;dico u otro especialista con respecto a las limitaciones funcionales espec&iacute;ficas del empleado, sus habilidades y las posibles acomodaciones razonables. El empleador tambi&eacute;n puede obtener valiosa informaci&oacute;n de otras personas que aunque no son especialistas, conocen las habilidades presentes del empleado, sus limitaciones y el uso de las acomodaciones razonables.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Cu&aacute;les son los requisitos de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable de la ADA con relaci&oacute;n a una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: La ADA requiere que un empleador ofrezca una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para compensar la limitaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sica o mental reconocida de un individuo calificado que tiene una deshabilidad, a menos que el empleador pueda demostrar que la acomodaci&oacute;n constituya una carga o costo excesivo. Una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable es una modificaci&oacute;n o adaptaci&oacute;n a un puesto de trabajo, al medio ambiente laboral o a la forma en que usualmente se hacen las cosas, para permitir a un individuo calificado con una deshabilidad poder desempe&ntilde;arse en dicho puesto y tener la misma oportunidad de trabajar. Otros folletos en esta serie tratan sobre las obligaciones de las acomodaciones razonables con m&aacute;s detalle. El t&oacute;pico de esta publicaci&oacute;n es basado espec&iacute;ficamente acerca de preguntas sobre las acomodaciones razonables relacionadas con una deshabilidad ocasionada por una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional.</p>  <p>La ADA no requiere que un empleador ofrezca una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable a un empleado que sufre una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional si este no tiene en la actualidad una deshabilidad reconocida por la ADA. Sin embargo, el empleador tiene la responsabilidad de ofrecer una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable si la persona tiene una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional.</p>  </div>  <h2>Licencias</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>Cuando una persona tiene una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional que le limita temporalmente para trabajar, el empleador no puede despedirlo(a) y debe darle una licencia, siempre y cuando &eacute;sta no se considere como una carga o como un costo excesivo. El empleado tiene el derecho de reincorporarse al mismo puesto a menos que el empleador pueda demostrar que mantener el puesto le ocasionar&iacute;a un costo excesivo. Si el empleador puede demostrar &eacute;sto, debe considerar si existe un puesto similar en el cual el empleado puede ser reasignado por los meses de licencia restantes. Si el empleado pide la licencia como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, pero el empleador puede darle una acomodaci&oacute;n que le permite seguir trabajando, el empleador no est&aacute; obligado bajo las normas de la ADA a otorgar la licencia. Pero, si el empleado simplemente pide una licencia, que normalmente se le ofrece a otros empleados, el empleador no puede obligar al empleado a seguir trabajando en el puesto a menos que tambi&eacute;n requiera que otros empleados sin deshabilidades sigan trabajando con alg&uacute;n tipo de modificaci&oacute;n. Adem&aacute;s, si el empleado califica para la licencia bajo le Ley de Licencias de Ausentismo por Razones Familiares y M&eacute;dicas &ldquo;FMLA&rdquo; , el empleador no puede exigir que &eacute;l / ella siga trabajando en el puesto con un cambio (acomodaci&oacute;n) en vez de tomar la licencia<sup>2</sup>.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\"><sup>2</sup>29 C.F.R. Secci&oacute;n 825.702(d)(1)(2001). En general, cuando cualquier asunto relacionado a licencias de ausentismo se presenta en un caso de la ADA, los empleadores necesitan estar concientes de que ellos tambi&eacute;n pueden tener obligaciones bajo la FMLA.

La reasignaci&oacute;n temporal o permanente a un cargo similar que este vacante, se debe hacer s&oacute;lo si no existe alguna otra alternativa de acomodar al empleado en el presente cargo, a trav&eacute;s de cambios en la estructura del puesto, la modificaci&oacute;n de aparatos o un horario de trabajo de medio tiempo. Si no existe un cargo vacante que sea equivalente a su cargo anterior se debe considerar la posibilidad de reasignar al empleado a un puesto de menor nivel. Sin embargo, el empleador y empleado pueden llegar a un acuerdo sobre la reasignaci&oacute;n en cualquier momento si piensan que &eacute;sta es la mejor soluci&oacute;n. Si no existe un cargo vacante para el empleado con una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional, el empleador no est&aacute; obligado a crear un nuevo puesto o a hacer que se le reasigne el puesto de un empleado(a) para d&aacute;rselo a la persona lesionada.</p>  <p>El empleador no estar&iacute;a cumpliendo con sus obligaciones de proveer acomodaciones razonables bajo las normas de la ADA, s&oacute;lo porque envia a un empleado con una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional a un programa vocacional de rehabilitaci&oacute;n para individuos que reciben prestaciones de compensaci&oacute;n laboral. Sin embargo, si tanto el empleador como el empleado est&aacute;n de acuerdo en que esta es la mejor soluci&oacute;n, ellos est&aacute;n en la libertad de escoger esta opci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>El empleador tambi&eacute;n puede hacer una modificaci&oacute;n en el lugar de trabajo no requerida bajo la ADA para contrarrestar los costos de compensaci&oacute;n laboral. Por ejemplo, un empleador puede decidir reducir temporalmente los requisitos de producci&oacute;n para que un empleado con una deshabilidad ocasionada por una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional, pueda reintegrarse a su trabajo lo m&aacute;s pronto posible.</p>  </div>  <h2>Trabajo liviano</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>El t&eacute;rmino &ldquo;trabajo liviano&rdquo; tiene varios significados en el &aacute;rea de empleo. La EEOC utiliza el t&eacute;rmino para definir ciertos puestos en particular que fueron creados espec&iacute;ficamente con el prop&oacute;sito de darle trabajo a aquellos empleados que no puedan desempe&ntilde;ar todas sus funciones regulares.</p>  <p>Un empleador se puede sentir obligado a crear un puesto de trabajo liviano debido a su relaci&oacute;n con el empleado cuando este se ha lesionado en el lugar de trabajo. La EEOC ha determinado que no existe ninguna norma en la ADA que proh&iacute;ba que un empleador pueda crear un puesto de trabajo liviano para un empleado que se ha lesionado en el lugar de trabajo, siempre y cuando esta medida<sup>3</sup> no discrimine contra alg&uacute;n empleado, incluyendo aquellos con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>La ADA no obliga a los empleadores a crear un puesto de trabajo liviano para un empleado con una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional. El principio general de la ADA que no requiere la creaci&oacute;n de puestos de trabajo aplica igualmente a la creaci&oacute;n de trabajo liviano. Sin embargo, si una persona lesionada no puede cumplir con algunas funciones marginales de trabajo pesado, estas funciones deben ser transferidas a otros empleados, como parte de la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable de la reestructuraci&oacute;n del puesto.</p>  <p>En caso de que el empleador decida crear posiciones de trabajo liviano para aquellos empleados lastimados en el trabajo, &eacute;l debe tambi&eacute;n determinar todas las caracter&iacute;sticas espec&iacute;ficas del puesto, incluyendo la duraci&oacute;n en la que este puesto estar&aacute; disponible. Por este motivo, si el empleador s&oacute;lo provee posiciones temporales de trabajo liviano, es necesario ofrecerle este tipo de cargos a un empleado con una deshabilidad relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional.</p>  <p>La EEOC establece que un empleador debe reasignar a un empleado con una deshabilidad no relacionada con una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional, pero considerada como tal bajo la ADA, a puestos con funciones livianas ya existentes que generalmente se reservan para empleados lastimados en el lugar de trabajo. La EEOC ha determinado que la reasignaci&oacute;n a puestos con funciones livianas vacantes pueden ser consideradas como acomodaciones razonables para un empleado(a) con una deshabilidad, que no ha sufrido una lesi&oacute;n ocupacional, pero que no puede cumplir con las funciones esenciales del cargo. La EEOC tambi&eacute;n ha determinado que un empleador no puede argumentar que &eacute;sto le va a causar una carga o costo excesivo si demuestra que en situaciones como esta no tendr&iacute;a m&aacute;s puestos vacantes de trabajo liviano para otro empleado que sufra una lesi&oacute;n laboral.</p>  <p>Al menos un tribunal no est&aacute; de acuerdo con la opini&oacute;n de la EEOC, y declar&oacute; que un empleador puede reservar puestos de funciones de trabajo liviano para aquellos empleados que se est&eacute;n recuperando de lesiones recientes y que tienen deshabilidades temporales <sup>4</sup>.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"\"footnote\"\">  <p><sup>3</sup> La EEOC deja abierta la posibilidad de que &eacute;sta pol&iacute;tica pueda tener un impacto diferente dependiendo del tipo de deshabilidad de la persona, el empleador tendr&iacute;a que demostrar que la pol&iacute;tica est&aacute; relacionada con el trabajo y con las necesidades del negocio.</p>  <p><sup>4</sup> Caso Dalton vs Subaru-Isuzu, 141 F .3d 667 &ldquo;7th Cir. 1998&rdquo;.</p>  </div>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;El hecho que un empleado presente una demanda por compensaci&oacute;n laboral lo limita a hacer una demanda bajo la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p>R: El hecho de iniciar una demanda de compensaci&oacute;n laboral no previene que un empleado lesionado pueda demandar tambi&eacute;n bajo las normas de la ADA.

Muchas empresas han reconocido la importancia de tratar el tema de la diversidad y est&aacute;n progresando en el establecimiento y desarrollo de iniciativas exitosas sobre la misma. Un catalizador fundamental responsable por la diversidad en el lugar de empleo es el cambio demogr&aacute;fico de la poblaci&oacute;n de los Estados Unidos y por lo tanto de la fuerza laboral de los estadounidenses.</p>  <p>Estudios demogr&aacute;ficos muestran que la composici&oacute;n de la poblaci&oacute;n de los E.E.U.U. es actualmente m&aacute;s diversa que nunca.

A medida que crece el numero de las personas con deshabilidades, tambi&eacute;n aumenta el de las personas de color con deshabilidades. Las personas con deshabilidades pertenecientes a minor&iacute;as se ven representadas de forma desproporcionada entre los desempleados y las perspectivas de empleo para &eacute;stos se ven sombr&iacute;as.</p>  <p>Considerando estos cambios en la poblaci&oacute;n y en el mercado laboral, existe una confianza creciente en la utilizaci&oacute;n de trabajadores no tradicionales y en la oportunidad para las organizaciones e individuos de capitalizar el conjunto de ideas, creatividad y contribuciones potenciales inherentes a una fuerza laboral variada.</p>  <p>El atraer, reclutar, desarrollar y retener una fuerza laboral calificada de poblaciones diversas es y seguir&aacute; siendo crucial para la supervivencia de la industria y el &eacute;xito organizacional.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es la Ley para Personas con Deshabilidades?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La Ley para Personas con Deshabilidades (A.D.A.) aprobada en 1990, es una legislaci&oacute;n que tiene el prop&oacute;sito de &ldquo;establecer una prohibici&oacute;n clara y contundente de la discriminaci&oacute;n basada en deshabilidad&rdquo; y asegurar el acceso y la participaci&oacute;n de personas con deshabilidades en la comunidad. Las regulaciones de la Ley se dirige espec&iacute;ficamente al empleo, a las acomodaciones p&uacute;blicas, a los servicios p&uacute;blicos(es decir, los servicios proporcionados por el gobierno local y estatal), a los servicios de transporte y de telecomunicaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>El T&iacute;tulo I de la A.D.A. prohibe que los empleadores con 15 o m&aacute;s empleados discriminen en contra de personas calificadas con deshabilidades bajo todo t&eacute;rmino, condici&oacute;n y en relaci&oacute;n a los privilegios de empleo incluyendo el reclutamiento, la evaluaci&oacute;n de pre-empleo, la contrataci&oacute;n, las prestaciones, promociones, conclusi&oacute;n del contrato de trabajo y despidos forzosos. La A.D.A. tambi&eacute;n est&aacute; dirigida hacia las organizaciones laborales, las agencias de empleo y los comit&eacute;s de co-administraci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>La A.D.A. tambi&eacute;n requiere que los empleadores provean acomodaciones razonables para personas calificadas con deshabilidades que les permitan llevar a cabo las funciones esenciales del cargo actual o deseado. Un empleador no puede negar una oportunidad de empleo a un solicitante o empleado con deshabilidades por haber solicitado una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Un empleador no esta obligado a brindar una acomodaci&oacute;n si puede demostrar que &eacute;sta constituye un cargo o costo excesivo.</p>  </div>  <h2>La Diversidad y la ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El t&eacute;rmino diversidad abarca diferentes aspectos como la raza, origen &eacute;tnico, g&eacute;nero, edad, religi&oacute;n, preferencias sexuales y deshabilidad. Los profesionales en las &aacute;reas de diversidad, deshabilidad y recursos humanos necesitan estar concientes de estas realidades cuando ayuden a sus empresas en la contrataci&oacute;n y retenci&oacute;n de los empleados, en el mercadeo y cuando caracterisen la diversidad dentro de sus organizaciones. Las personas con deshabilidades, incluyendo las personas de grupos minoritarios con deshabilidades tienen la capacidad de hacer contribuciones positivas en el lugar de trabajo y para el &eacute;xito de las organizaciones.</p>  <p>Hoy en d&iacute;a, las iniciativas relacionadas con el tema de la diversidad est&aacute;n menos orientadas hacia la preferencia por la diferencia (&ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo;), porque ahora reflejan tanto la valoraci&oacute;n como el manejo de la diversidad. La valoraci&oacute;n de la diversidad implica el reconocimiento y la apreciaci&oacute;n de las diferencias entre individuos. El buen manejo de la diversidad contribuye con el desarrollo de la cultura, las pol&iacute;ticas y los objetivos empresariales, optimizando la productividad de todos los empleados comprendiendo sus necesidades particulares, motivaciones y contribuciones. Adem&aacute;s, algunos proyectos piloto modelo han demostrado que las iniciativas relacionadas con el tema de la diversidad requieren tanto del apoyo directo como del compromiso de los altos niveles de gerencia.</p>  <p>Las iniciativas exitosas sobre el tema de la diversidad pueden incluir una variedad de programas. En general &eacute;stas incluyen algun tipo de entrenamiento as&iacute; como esfuerzos para cambiar las normas de comunicaci&oacute;n de la organizaci&oacute;n. Por ejemplo la aplicaci&oacute;n de encuestas a los empleados, la creaci&oacute;n de redes de empleados, el entrenamiento sobre manejo de la diversidad, programas de mentor&iacute;a y el uso de redes internas de comunicaci&oacute;n en la empresa son maneras de evaluar y ampliar la forma de pensar de los empleados y la administraci&oacute;n. Adem&aacute;s, muchas corporaciones est&uacute;dian sus sistemas de incentivos para asegurar que el empleado no sea evaluado por su estilo personal si no por los m&eacute;ritos en su trabajo. Como parte de la iniciativa a veces se incluye la flexibilidad en los horarios de trabajo.</p>  <p>Los empleadores est&aacute;n tomando medidas para garantizar el cumplimiento de las disposiciones de empleo de la A.D.A. en sus ambientes de trabajo. Esto puede implicar el entrenamiento del personal en los siguientes temas relacionados con la implementaci&oacute;n de la A.D.A. :</p>  <p>*Evaluaci&oacute;n previa a la oferta de trabajo y a la entrevista del solicitante bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A.</p>  <p>*La relaci&oacute;n entre la A.D.A. y las leyes sobre empleo y no - discriminaci&oacute;n de otros estados o a nivel federal.</p>  <p>*Desarrollo de perfiles de trabajo que de forma clara y contundente identifiquen las funciones esenciales del cargo.</p>  <p>*El proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>*Igualdad de oportunidades laborales y consideraciones de ascensos profesionales para las personas con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>*Evaluaciones de desenvolvimiento profesional sin discriminaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>*Relaciones de empleados con otros empleados con deshabilidades (miembros o no de grupos minoritarios).</p>  <p>*Manejo de las relaciones comerciales con clientes con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>*El manejo del conflicto/negociaci&oacute;n en el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>En resumen, entre las implicaciones para los empleadores que enfrentan y entienden la relaci&oacute;n existente entre diversidad y deshabilidad, se hayan las siguientes:</p>  <p>*Mejores esfuerzos en reclutamiento y retenci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>*Mejor productividad.</p>  <p>*Programas de entrenamiento m&aacute;s amplios que incluya tanto la diversidad (&oacute;tnica, religiosa y de g&eacute;nero), como las deshabilidades. Ampliaci&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas y programas.</p>  <p>*Mejor esp&iacute;ritu de trabajo en equipo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&amp;#233 es una Acomodaci&oacute;n Razonable?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Una Acomodaci&oacute;n Razonable es cualquier modificaci&oacute;n de las funciones de trabajo o adaptaci&oacute;n a un trabajo, a las disposiciones de empleo o del ambiente laboral que permitan que un individuo calificado con deshabilidades pueda solicitar un empleo y desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del mismo.</p>  <p>Una Acomodaci&oacute;n Razonable incluye entre otros la modificaci&oacute;n o el ajuste del proceso de solicitud de trabajo para permitir que las personas con deshabilidades puedan aplicar para un empleo, haciendo los ajustes necesarios en las instalaciones para que sean f&aacute;cilmente accesibles y utilizables por las personas con deshabilidades; modificar los horarios de trabajo, la reasignaci&oacute;n de las funciones no esenciales del trabajo, la adquisici&oacute;n o el ajuste de equipos o aparatos y la reinstalaci&oacute;n a un cargo disponible. Un empleador no est&aacute; obligado a redistribuir las funciones esenciales de un trabajo o a crear puestos de trabajo &ldquo;menos pesados&rdquo;.</p>  <p>Un empleador no est&aacute; obligado a brindar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable si puede demostrar que &eacute;sta constituir&aacute; un costo excesivo. Si una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable ocasiona o no un costo excesivo &eacute;sta es una realidad que depende de factores como: la naturaleza y el costo neto de la acomodaci&oacute;n, el tama&ntilde;o y la naturaleza de la industria. La obligaci&oacute;n de brindar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable depende de cada caso espec&iacute;fico.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;En qu&eacute; consiste el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Para identificar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A., en el caso de que una acomodaci&oacute;n eficaz no sea obvia, el empleador junto con el empleado podr&aacute;n iniciar un proceso de di&aacute;logo flexible e interactivo.</p>  <p>Generalmente si una persona con deshabilidad quiere una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, &eacute;l o ella deber&aacute; pedirla. Si el empleador no la lleva a cabo, &eacute;ste debe identificar las funciones esenciales del trabajo en cuesti&oacute;n y luego consultar con el individuo que ha pedido la acomodaci&oacute;n, para determinar si las limitaciones relacionadas con el trabajo son debidas a la deshabilidad del individuo asi como la forma en que estas limitaciones podr&aacute;n ser superadas gracias a una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>Se deber&aacute;n evaluar las posibles acomodaciones y seleccionar la m&aacute;s eficaz. A&uacute;n cuando las preferencias del empleado sean tomadas en cuenta, el empleador tiene el derecho de escoger entre acomodaciones razonables de igual efectividad.</p>  <p>Es crucial que el concepto de no-discriminaci&oacute;n y de iguales oportunidades de acceso para todas las personas con deshabilidades sea un tema de di&aacute;logo permanente en el lugar de empleo. Es m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil hacer una acomodaci&oacute;n que satisfaga las necesidades espec&iacute;ficas del individuo cuando las organizaciones promueven un clima de acuerdo para acatar los principios y los requisitos de la A.D.A. Por ejemplo, si una persona se encuentra en dificultades para el desempe&ntilde;o de una funci&oacute;n no esencial del trabajo, la acomodaci&oacute;n consiste en pedirle a otros empleados que se encarguen de algunas de estas tareas. Sin embargo, es m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil realizar una redistribuci&oacute;n de funciones si los empleados est&aacute;n capacitados sobre los temas de acomodaci&oacute;n a trav&eacute;s de entrenamientos previos y de un di&aacute;logo permanente de grupo.</p>  <p>La A.D.A. incluye reglamentaciones estrictas de completa confidencialidad por lo que concierne a la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica obtenida durante un examen o un estudio m&eacute;dico. La informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica debe ser recopilada y archivada en formularios separados y en archivos m&eacute;dicos y &eacute;sta debe mantenerse confidencial. Existen algunas circumstancias espec&iacute;ficas en las cuales se pueden divulgar este tipo de datos, como puede ser informar a supervisores y administradores sobre restricciones de trabajo o acomodaciones necesarias.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; tipo de estrategias se han sugerido para elevar el nivel de conciencia sobre los temas de la diversidad en el lugar de trabajo, de las personas de diversidad cultural con deshabilidades y de la A.D.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Una implementaci&oacute;n exitosa de iniciativas sobre diversidad y la A.D.A. requiere esfuerzos para cambiar la cultura y las actitudes de las corporaciones. Ambas indican la necesidad de entrenar al personal en pr&aacute;cticas no discriminatorias, conciencia de la diversidad, habilidades relacionadas con la diversidad, flexibilidad en cuanto a los horarios de trabajo e investigaci&oacute;n sobre evaluaci&oacute;n e incentivos para los empleados. La naturaleza similar de estas estrategias sugiere que la combinaci&oacute;n de iniciativas sobre deshabilidad y diversidad es posible y podr&iacute;a ser ventajosa para el &eacute;xito de ambos esfuerzos.</p>  <p>Las siguientes son estrategias seleccionadas que podr&iacute;an fomentar las iniciativas sobre diversidad y la implementaci&oacute;n de la A.D.A.:</p>  <p>*Iniciativas sobre diversidad que incluyan un reclutamiento efectivo y una retenci&oacute;n de individuos con deshabilidades de todo tipo de origen y experiencia en el lugar de empleo a trav&eacute;s de acuerdos de colaboraci&oacute;n con agencias estatales de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional o servicios locales de empleo para individuos con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>*Desarrollo de programas de trabajo dirigidos a las minor&iacute;as con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>*Desarrollo de un programa de mentor&iacute;a para personas con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>*Brindar entrenamiento, desarrollo y oportunidades de promoci&oacute;n a todas las minor&iacute;as en busca de un ascenso profesional. Por ejemplo brindar el apoyo necesario a toda clase de individuos con deshabilidades para permitirles acceso a programas de entrenamiento, la consideraci&oacute;n de nuevas funciones de trabajo o recibir un nuevo entrenamiento necesario en caso de que una deshabilidad les impida el regreso a sus funciones previas de trabajo.</p>  <p>*La integraci&oacute;n de los requisitos de no-discriminaci&oacute;n de la A.D.A. y del T&iacute;tulo VII de la Ley de Derechos Civiles para personas con deshabilidades en todos los aspectos del entrenamiento del personal y de los procedimientos de recursos humanos.</p>  <p>Estas s&oacute;lo son algunas de muchas iniciativas proactivas que los empleadores pueden implementar para reclutar y retener individuos con deshabilidades en el lugar de empleo, expandiendo de esta manera sus recursos laborales y maximizando el talento humano para incrementar los resultados en el lugar de trabajo.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Susanne M.

La Suprema Corte de Justicia ha definido que una deshabilidad realmente limita las actividades mayores en el trabajo si un individuo es incapaz o se considera como incapaz de realizar una amplia variedad de trabajos.</p>  <p>La Suprema Corte tambi&eacute;n ha determinado que la reproducci&oacute;n es considerada como una actividad importante en la vida bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A.

La Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo, en su gu&iacute;a de cumplimiento provicional de 1993 describi&oacute; como se aplican las regulaciones de A.D.A. en las prestaciones del plan de salud.</p>  <p>Primero, la A.D.A. le exige a los empleadores que se les provean a todos los empleados ( con o sin deshabilidades ) las prestaciones de seguro m&eacute;dico. Por lo tanto, un empleador no puede tomar parte en un contrato o arreglo discriminatorio con una organizaci&oacute;n que provee prestaciones marginales a los empleados.</p>  <p>Sin embargo, el derecho a recibir prestaciones de seguro m&eacute;dico no necesita ser extendido a los empleados con deshabilidades si estas prestaciones no se extienden a empleados con deshabilidades en circunstancias similares; como por ejemplo, los empleados de medio tiempo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; clase de cobertura permite la A.D.A.?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El T&iacute;tulo V de la A.D.A. permite al asegurado de Buena fe o empleado autoasegurado con un plan de prestaciones de seguro para hacer una distinci&oacute;n relacionada con la salud. Basada en la clasificaci&oacute;n de riesgo, y tambi&eacute;n basada o no con la Ley Estatal; sin embargo esta excepci&oacute;n de seguro no puede ser usada como para evadir los fines de la A.D.A. De acuerdo a la E.E.O.C. , las distinciones en seguros m&eacute;dicos que no estan basadas en deshabilidades, no infringen las regulaciones de la A.D.A., a&uacute;n cuando estas tengan un imp&aacute;cto desproporcionado sobre las personas con deshabilidades; por lo tanto, los empleadores, las aseguradoras y los sindicatos habitualmente solicitan la distinci&oacute;n de seguro que es aplicado a todos los empleados de igual manera; tales como: las limitaciones y exclusiones concernientes; por ejemplo, los empleadores podr&iacute;an ofrecer seguros m&eacute;dicos que no cubren condiciones preexistentes por un periodo de tiempo especificado en el plan, a&uacute;n cuando esta condici&oacute;n preexistente afecte adversamente a los empleados con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>Generalmente la A.D.A. tambi&eacute;n permite limitaciones neutrales, tales como, la cobertura de por vida en l&iacute;mites m&aacute;ximos. Adem&aacute;s, un plan de salud puede excluir o limitar la cobertura para procedimientos o tratamientos espec&iacute;ficos si estos no son exclusivamente o parcialmente exclusivos para aplicarse a una deshabilidad en particular; por ejemplo, un plan podr&iacute;a limitar el n&uacute;mero de transfuciones de sangre o de rayos x que el plan pagara, a&uacute;n cuando esto pueda tener un efecto prejudicial en personas que tengan ciertas deshabilidades como la hemofilia de igual manera, un plan puede limitar o negar la cobertura para todos los tratamientos y/o drogas &ldquo;experimentales&rdquo; para todas las cirug&iacute;as voluntarias y excluir o proveer niveles inferiores de cobertura para una diversidad de categorias que no estan contempladas en la l&iacute;nea de deshabilidades; por ejemplo, un plan puede tener una taza de reembolso para un tratamiento de &ldquo;condici&oacute;n nerviosa o mental&rdquo; o por &ldquo;cuidado de los ojos&oacute;. Sin embargo, todas estas provisiones son permitidas bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A. solo si estas cumplen con los requisitos de la Leyes Estatales aplicables y no son usadas como escapatorias. Los t&eacute;rminos de los planes de seguro tambi&eacute;n tienen que cumplir con los requisitos de otras Leyes Federales aplicables, tales como Seguro de Salud de Portabilidad, Ley de responsabilidad, Ley de Igualdad de Salud Mental.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es una distinci&oacute;n basada en deshabilidad?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las gu&iacute;as de cumplimento de E.E.O.C. identifican un t&eacute;rmino en el plan o disposici&oacute;n como basada en deshabilidad si &eacute;sta enfatiza una deshabilidad en particular, un grupo de diferentes deshabilidades, deshabilidad en general.

Los patrocinadores de los planes de salud pueden utilizar principios com&uacute;nmente aceptados de clasificaci&oacute;n de riesgos de seguros, as&iacute; como datos recientes y precisos, pero no datos basados en mitos, temores, estereotipos o suposiciones acerca de las deshabilidades completamente falsas y anticuadas. Las limitaciones o exclusiones basadas en una deshabilidad no ser&aacute;n consideradas como violatorias de la ADA si:</p>  <p>1. est&aacute;n basadas en datos actuariales leg&iacute;timos, o en experiencia actualizada o razonablemente anterior, y se aplican por igual a condiciones con datos actuariales y/o experiencia comparables;</p>  <p>2. o son necesarias porque no hay una alternativa disponible a una distinci&oacute;n basada en una deshabilidad para evitar un cambio &ldquo;inaceptable&rdquo; tal como:</p>  <p>*un aumento dr&aacute;stico en primas, co-pagos o deducibles;</p>  <p>* una alteraci&oacute;n dr&aacute;stica en el alcance de la cobertura o nivel de beneficios; u</p>  <p>* otros cambios que har&iacute;an el plan inaccesible a un significativo n&uacute;mero de los otros empleados, o tan poco atractivo que el empleador no podr&aacute; competir en la selecci&oacute;n y retenci&oacute;n de trabajadores calificados debido a la superioridad de los planes de salud de otras compa&ntilde;&iacute;as en la comunidad, o tan poco atractivos que resultan en resultados de selecci&oacute;n adversos.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es una escapatoria ?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La E.E.O.C. y algunos Tribunales definene el t&eacute;rmino escapatoria como un tratamiento diferente basado en una deshabilidad, la informaci&oacute;n del actuario de seguros que no esta asentado en los registros actuales de seguros o la experiencia real o razonable anticipada del empleador relacionada al riezgo que &eacute;sta representa. Esto quiere decir que cualquier l&iacute;mite o exclusi&oacute;n en la cobertura basada en deshabilidad tiene que ser justificada, registros actuariales ver&iacute;dicos u otras justificaciones y de seguros.</p>  <p>Por ejemplo; el tope m&aacute;ximo en prestaci&oacute;n para las enfermedades relacionadas con el SIDA que eran mucho menores que para otras enfermedades podr&iacute;a ser una distinci&oacute;n basada en deshabilidad. La disminuci&oacute;n del tope m&aacute;ximo de cobertura para el SIDA puede infringir las regulaciones de la A.D.A. a menos que la distinci&oacute;n basada en la deshabilidad se puede justificar con un registro actuarial. Estudios han demostrado que el costo de tratamiento de SIDA es comparable a los costos de otras condiciones comunmente cubiertas &eacute;sto hace que sea improbable que &eacute;ste tipo de distinciones puedan justificarse.</p>  <p>Tambi&eacute;n se puede encontrar que un plan puede utilizar la excepci&oacute;n del seguro como una escapatoria si se utiliza un l&iacute;mite menor en la cobertura para el tratamiento del SIDA para disuadir a las personas con la enfermedad del SIDA a aceptar el empleo o a registrarse en el plan m&eacute;dico.</p>  <p>Algunos Tribunales han decretado que las pr&aacute;cticas de este plan establecidas con anterioridad a la aprobaci&oacute;n de la Ley para personas con deshabilidades podr&iacute;an utilizar la escapatoria para evadir el prop&oacute;sito de la Ley; sin embargo, la E.E.O.C. debate que la A.D.A. provee &ldquo;un amparo o protecci&oacute;n&rdquo; para pr&aacute;cticas discriminatorias adoptadas antes de la A.D.A..</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo Regula la ADA la Cobertura de los Dependientes?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las distinciones basadas en una deshabilidad que involucran la cobertura de dependientes ser&aacute;n analizadas de la misma manera que las distinciones aplicadas en la cobertura del empleado.

Estos especialistas est&aacute;n encargados del reclutamiento, evaluaci&oacute;n y de la aplicaci&oacute;n de las pruebas de pre-empleo, y del proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, as&iacute; como de los beneficios, administraci&oacute;n del desempe&ntilde;o, las necesidades debido a cierta discapacidad y otras facetas del proceso de empleo. Debido a la amplitud de su participaci&oacute;n, estos profesionales se encuentran en una posici&oacute;n muy favorable para ayudar a las organizaciones a determinar el objetivo de la ADA y reducir al m&iacute;nimo la discriminaci&oacute;n por deshabilidad. El prop&oacute;sito de esta publicaci&oacute;n es identificar algunos de los temas en los que la contribuci&oacute;n de los profesionales en Recursos Humanos puede ayudar a las organizaciones comerciales a crear una cultura y un proceso que facilite la implementaci&oacute;n de los requisitos de la ADA con respecto a la acomodaci&oacute;n y reducir al m&iacute;nimo la posibilidad de discriminaci&oacute;n contra solicitantes y empleados con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>Aproximadamente el 14 por ciento de los ciudadanos estadounidenses tienen alg&uacute;n tipo de discapacidad. Muchos de ellos est&aacute;n desempleados o trabajan en puestos inferiores a su capacidad, en comparaci&oacute;n a sus colegas no discapacitados, y representan una inmensa y hasta ahora desperdiciada fuente de posibles empleados en los Estados Unidos.</p>  <p>Al analizar las continuas barreras al empleo para personas con deshabilidades desde el momento en que la ADA ha entrado en vigor, la Sociedad para la Administraci&oacute;n de Recursos Humanos (SHRM) se uni&oacute; a la Universidad de Cornell en el oto&ntilde;o de 1988 para llevar a cabo una encuesta sobre los miembros de la SHRM. Esta investigaci&oacute;n estaba basada en la idea de que la implementaci&oacute;n de las previsiones de las leyes acerca de la no-discriminaci&oacute;n por deshabilidad es frecuentemente una de las funciones de los especialistas en Recursos Humanos, quienes habitualmente son los responsables por las pr&aacute;cticas y pol&iacute;ticas del empleo que afectan la contrataci&oacute;n y retenci&oacute;n de empleados con o sin deshabilidades. Esta gu&iacute;a le ofrece sugerencias para incrementar la contribuci&oacute;n de los profesionales de Recursos Humanos hacia la implementaci&oacute;n de la ADA y ofrece recomendaciones basadas en los resultados de esta encuesta con respecto a los miembros de la SHRM.</p>  </div>  <h2>1) Motive a los solicitantes con deshabilidades y minimice la discriminaci&oacute;n innecesaria durante los procesos de aplicaci&oacute;n, evaluaci&oacute;n de pre-empleo y en el proceso de selecci&oacute;n.</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>En los Estados Unidos aproximadamente el 34 por ciento de los hombres y el 35 por ciento de las mujeres con deshabilidades trabajaron durante 1999, en comparaci&oacute;n al 95 por ciento de los hombres y 82 por ciento de las mujeres no-discapacitados. Aunque la ADA no requiere el uso de programas como la Acci&oacute;n Afirmativa (Affirmative Action, programa de ayuda a grupos minoritarios) , como lo requiere La Ley de Rehabilitaci&oacute;n para los contratistas federales que tienen recursos mayores de $10,000 y para aquellas personas que reciben fondos federales, estas estad&iacute;sticas confirman que las personas discapacitadas siguen siendo una fuente desperdiciada de posibles trabajadores. Los especialistas del departamento de Recursos Humanos pueden fomentar y facilitar la aplicaci&oacute;n de personas con deshabilidades a puestos vacantes al asegurarse que las agencias de servicios de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional locales est&eacute;n informadas acerca de la existencia de estos puestos. Algunas de estas entidades son agencias estatales de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional (que est&aacute;n listadas en el directorio telef&oacute;nico local), programas de apoyo en el empleo o de rehabilitaci&oacute;n en la comunidad, centros de inversi&oacute;n estatal en la fuente laboral, centros de asistencia en colocaci&oacute;n de empleo conocidos como ONE Stop, as&iacute; como otros programas.</p>  <p>Los especialistas en Recursos Humanos tambi&eacute;n pueden ayudar a la integraci&oacute;n de personas con deshabilidades a la fuente laboral, al minimizar las evaluaciones innecesarias para estas personas en los cargos que requieran evaluaciones y ex&aacute;menes de pre-empleo. Ni la aplicaci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo, ni las entrevistas deben incluir preguntas para obtener informaci&oacute;n de car&aacute;cter m&eacute;dico o relacionadas con una discapacidad, ni tampoco preguntas sobre aplicaciones anteriores con respecto al programa de compensaci&oacute;n a los empleados; por cierto, la ADA proh&iacute;be este tipo de preguntas sin que anteriormente se haya hecho una oferta condicional de empleo. Cualquier evaluaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica de pre-empleo debe hacerse luego de realizarse una oferta de trabajo y toda evaluaci&oacute;n de este tipo debe estar de acuerdo con los requisitos espec&iacute;ficos del puesto y las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p>Adem&aacute;s, el reclutamiento, el proceso de aplicaci&oacute;n y las entrevistas deben ser accesibles para aquellos candidatos con discapacidades ambulatorias, de la vista y del o&iacute;do. Algunos ejemplos de una preparaci&oacute;n adecuada para ofrecer el acceso son: mantener materiales de reclutamiento y aplicaciones en formatos alternativos as&iacute; como conocer d&oacute;nde encontrar en la comunidad int&szlig;rpretes de lenguaje se&ntilde;as. Si desea informaci&oacute;n adicional acerca de la evaluaci&oacute;n y ex&aacute;menes de pre-empleo la puede encontrar en otros folletos de esta serie.</p>  </div>  <h2>2) Revise todos los procesos de pol&iacute;tica de empleo, procedimientos y formatos para hacer consideraciones de no-discriminaci&oacute;n por deshabilidad y acceso</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El proceso de reclutamiento y evaluaci&oacute;n es un punto apropiado para iniciar la evaluaci&oacute;n de las pol&iacute;ticas y procedimientos de la organizaci&oacute;n con respecto al alcance efectivo de personas discapacitadas, reduciendo al m&iacute;nimo las barreras en los procesos de aplicaci&oacute;n y evaluaci&oacute;n. Sin embargo, es importante recordar que la ADA aplica a todo el proceso de empleo. Por lo tanto, los especialistas de Recursos Humanos deben analizar cuidadosamente todo el proceso de empleo, teniendo en cuenta la no-discriminaci&oacute;n con respecto a la discapacidad. Por ejemplo, los programas de beneficios m&eacute;dicos o de hospitalizaci&oacute;n, de accidentes, seguro de vida, de jubilaci&oacute;n, y programas de compensaci&oacute;n al trabajador deben ser examinados para asegurar igualdad de participaci&oacute;n de las personas con discapacidades en estos planes de beneficios al empleado. Aunque los empleadores pueden acatar la informaci&oacute;n aprobada por la Mesa Directiva estatal de compa&ntilde;&iacute;as de seguros, se proh&iacute;ben las exclusiones o limitaciones espec&iacute;ficas debido a la discapacidad. Se debe garantizar el mismo derecho al acceso a otros beneficios relacionados con el empleo, como puede ser poder utilizar la cafeter&iacute;a, las infraestructuras deportivas en el sitio de trabajo o en otro sitio que tenga contrato para el uso de los empleados; otras actividades sociales y recreativas que se lleven a cabo peri&oacute;dicamente deben ser evaluadas en cuanto al acceso para empleados con deshabilidades. Se debe determinar si los establecimientos son accesibles para personas con deshabilidades ambulatorias y si se ofrecen avisos adecuados para personas con deshabilidades visuales.</p>  <p>El entrenamiento y otras oportunidades de capacitaci&oacute;n profesional deben ser igualmente accesibles para aquellos empleados discapacitados de la organizaci&oacute;n. Las oportunidades para ascensos deben ser ofrecidas a todos los empleados y los establecimientos y procesos de entrenamiento debe ser analizados para asegurar la accesibilidad para empleados con deshabilidades. Se deben hacer preguntas como por ejemplo: &iquest;son las p&aacute;ginas electr&oacute;nicas o los anuncios en imprenta sobre entrenamientos accesibles a las personas con deshabilidades visuales? &iquest;son los establecimientos donde se lleva a cabo el entrenamiento accesibles a personas en sillas de ruedas y &iquest;se tienen materiales de entrenamiento en formatos alternos (texto en letras grandes, disco de computadora, cinta de audio, o en Braille&amp;#41 ;?</p>  <p>De igual manera los procesos de quejas, sanciones temporales o despidos definitivos, deben ser analizados para asegurarse que las personas discapacitadas no son tratadas de forma diferente durante estos procesos.</p>  </div>  <h2>3) Cree una estructura organizacional que apoye los procesos de acomodaci&oacute;n.</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La EEOC sugiere un proceso informal e interactivo entre el empleado y el representante de la organizaci&oacute;n para determinar la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Este representante de la organizaci&oacute;n puede ser un supervisor, un miembro del departamento de Recursos Humanos, otra persona. La solicitud para la acomodaci&oacute;n puede ser requerida directamente por la persona en cuesti&oacute;n a su supervisor inmediato, pero &eacute;ste es a menudo un proceso que involucra varios niveles de la compa&iacute;a para darle soluci&oacute;n al problema y el cual se pone en marcha cuando la solicitud se realiza. En la evaluaci&oacute;n de los miembros de la SHRM hecha por la Universidad de Cornell, aproximadamente un cuarto de las personas participantes indicaron que el representante de Recursos Humanos toma la decisi&oacute;n definitiva sobre las acomodaciones por si solo, mientras que el 10 por ciento declar&oacute; que el representante de Recursos Humanos colabora con otros supervisores para tomar la decisi&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Debido a que frecuentemente una indagaci&oacute;n va a ser dirigida directamente a un supervisor, es de suma importancia que &eacute;stos est&eacute;n enterados del proceso para tomar una decisi&oacute;n sobre acomodaciones en la organizaci&oacute;n. Los especialistas del departamento de Recursos Humanos deber&aacute;n informarles acerca de los requisitos para acomodaciones en relaci&oacute;n con la ADA y dejarles saber que un especialista de este departamento puede ayudar en el proceso de resoluci&oacute;n del problema. Estos especialistas tambi&eacute;n pueden referir a los supervisores a recursos que puedan servir para determinar cual acomodaci&oacute;n va a ser m&aacute;s efectiva para satisfacer las necesidades de la persona. Estos pueden ser recursos en la organizaci&oacute;n misma o la comunidad en general, incluyendo los ergonomistas, profesionales en el campo de la salud o seguridad, y los profesionales de asistencia a los empleados. Adem&aacute;s, &iacute;i existe un costo relacionado con la acomodaci&oacute;n y la unidad comercial individual no puede pagar por este costo, se le puede pedir ayuda a una oficina central para encontrar los fondos adicionales necesarios para cubrir el costo de esta acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>4) Seguimiento y registro organizacional de las acomodaciones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Aunque la ADA no obliga mantener informaci&oacute;n sobre las acomodaciones se aconseja a las organizaciones utilizar un sistema de seguimiento del proceso de desarrollo de la acomodaci&oacute;n. Esto le permitir&aacute; documentar a la organizaci&oacute;n su esfuerzo de buena fe al responder a las solicitudes de acomodaci&oacute;n del personal. Adem&aacute;s, &eacute;sto mejorar&aacute; la pol&iacute;tica institucional de registro pr&aacute;ctico de las acomodaciones efectivas en ciertas categor&iacute;as de empleos as&iacute; como sobre temas relacionados con la discapacidad.</p>  <p>Casi la mitad de las personas que respondieron a la encuesta de la SHRM y la Universidad de Cornell indicaron que sus organizaciones recopilaron informaci&oacute;n sobre las acomodaciones hechas para empleados con deshabilidades para de esta manera poder solucionar casos de acomodaciones futuras en situaciones similares. Aproximadamente un tercio de las personas que respondieron tambi&eacute;n recopilaron informaci&oacute;n para cumplir con los requisitos regulatorios de los reportes en caso de ser utilizados en la resoluci&oacute;n de conflictos y para recopilar informaci&oacute;n sobre los costos de la acomodaci&oacute;n. Aproximadamente un tercio de las personas consultadas indicaron que estas organizaciones no mantuvieron archivos con informaci&oacute;n sobre las previsiones de las organizaciones.</p>  </div>  <h2>5) Compromiso del nivel alto de gerencia con una pol&iacute;tica de no-discriminaci&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Ning&uacute;n cambio organizacional importante ocurre sin que exista un compromiso de los l&iacute;deres gerenciales con el resto de la organizaci&oacute;n. De igual manera, para asegurar la efectividad en el reclutamiento, la contrataci&oacute;n, la integraci&oacute;n y la acomodaci&oacute;n de las personas con deshabilidades, los dirigentes administrativos deben afirmar y comunicar efectivamente la importancia de reclutar y mantener empleadas a este tipo de individuos con deshabilidades. Esto puede ser parte del mensaje acerca de la importancia de la diversidad, el cual se debe ser comunicado expl&iacute;citamente para comprometer a las estructuras administrativas y de supervisi&oacute;n de la organizaci&oacute;n con respecto a su colaboraci&oacute;n con este objetivo. Al asegurarse que el nivel alto de gerencia considere este tema no s&oacute;lo porque hay que darle cumplimiento, sino para demostrar que la administraci&oacute;n manda el mensaje adecuado como motivador significativo para garantizar el cumplimiento efectivo de las normas de la ADA en el sitio de trabajo. En la encuesta de la Universidad de Cornell a los miembros de la SHRM, el compromiso de los altos niveles de gerencia fue visto como la forma m&aacute;s efectiva de minimizar las continuas barreras para personas con deshabilidades en el lugar de trabajo.</p>  </div>  <h2>6) Clarifique los requisitos de la posici&oacute;n y las expectativas del desempe&ntilde;o</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La ADA no requiere que los empleadores tengan descripciones de sus trabajos por escrito. Sin embargo, las descripciones escritas preparadas apropiadamente son de fundamental importancia para un desempe&ntilde;o efectivo de la gerencia. Descripciones exactas de los trabajos son herramientas para un reclutamiento efectivo y para la retenci&oacute;n de buenos trabajadores, incluyendo a las personas con deshabilidades. Las descripciones de las funciones del trabajo sirven como gu&iacute;a para los supervisores, entrevistadores, personal m&eacute;dico e incluso para los aspirantes y empleados a trav&eacute;s del proceso del empleo. La descripci&oacute;n actualizada identificando las funciones esenciales del puesto deber&aacute; ser redactada antes de empezar el reclutamiento y de publicarse el anuncio del puesto. Los solicitantes pueden recibir una copia de este anuncio con la descripci&oacute;n del cargo para de esta manera identificar y dar soluci&oacute;n a una acomodaci&oacute;n en caso de ser requerida. La descripci&oacute;n del puesto tambi&eacute;n puede servir para aclarar las expectativas sobre el desempe&ntilde;o de una persona, una vez &eacute;sta ha sido contratada. Las personas con deshabilidades deben cumplir con los mismos requisitos sobre su desempe&ntilde;o como otros empleados en la misma categor&iacute;a laboral, pero acomodaciones razonables necesarias deben ser ofrecidas, a menos que esto resulte en una carga excesiva.</p>  </div>  <h2>7) Proporcione entrenamiento y comunicaci&oacute;n continua acerca de los requisitos del ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El entrenamiento es clave. El entrenamiento es importante en todo nivel de la organizaci&oacute;n. No s&oacute;lo para los entrevistadores. No s&oacute;lo para los supervisores de contrataci&oacute;n, pero para todos los empleados. &iquest;Por qu&eacute;? La ADA no es solamente una ley para garantizar el mismo acceso a las personas con deshabilidades. Tambi&eacute;n tiene que ver con la sensitividad relacionada con el hecho de considerar nuestro comportamiento y actitudes para de esta manera determinar si podemos ser parte o no del problema de asegurar igual acceso a las oportunidades de empleo. Esto nos permite estar seguros de saber que por el contrario somos parte de la soluci&oacute;n al ofrecer las mismas oportunidades en el empleo.</p>  <p>Los miembros de la SHRM que participaron en la encuesta declararon que hab&iacute;an ofrecido entrenamiento extensivo a los representantes de Recursos Humanos, pero un entrenamiento muy b&aacute;sico para los supervisores de las empresas. En orden de garantizar su efectividad, el entrenamiento sobre la no-discriminaci&oacute;n por discapacidad debe llegar al nivel de los supervisores, para informarles sobre sus responsabilidades con respecto a la ADA. Algunos temas de utilidad pueden ser: los requisitos de confidencialidad sobre la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, la no-discriminaci&oacute;n en el proceso de disciplina o despido, la no-discriminaci&oacute;n en el proceso de reclutamiento y contrataci&oacute;n, la definici&oacute;n de las funciones b&aacute;sicas del cargo, y el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n. Informaci&oacute;n adicional sobre el entrenamiento con relaci&oacute;n a la ADA se puede encontrar en otro folleto de esta serie.</p>  </div>  <h2>8) Si en la empresa existe un sindicato, involucre a los representantes de esta organizaci&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El sindicato puede tener una funci&oacute;n importante para ayudar a que una persona discapacitada reciba la acomodaci&oacute;n necesaria para desempe&ntilde;arse efectivamente en el lugar de trabajo. Los sindicatos tambi&eacute;n est&aacute;n sujetos bajo las normas de la ADA. Usted deber&iacute;a trabajar en conjunto con ellos para asegurar que exista una flexibilidad en los contratos que permita realizar las acomodaciones requeridas, si estas son apropiadas. Las normas de la ADA sugieren que los t&eacute;rminos y condiciones de los acuerdos para la negociaci&oacute;n colectiva puedan utilizarse como un factor determinante para considerar si una acomodaci&oacute;n puede constituirse en una carga o costo excesivo. Sin embargo, usted deber&iacute;a considerar todos los factores y enfocarse en mantener sus esfuerzos de buena fe con el sindicato. Lo m&aacute;s importante es concentrarse en la obligaci&oacute;n legal conjunta para garantizar que la persona con deshabilidad reciba la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que necesita.</p>  <p>En el estudio llevado a cabo por la SHRM y la Universidad de Cornell, los participantes indicaron que el sindicato podr&iacute;a contribuir en el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n de la siguiente forma: ofreciendo un representante para que est&eacute; presente en los di&aacute;logos relacionados con las acomodaciones razonables; brindando consejos o informaci&oacute;n sobre diferentes formas de acomodar a los empleados con discapacidades, ofreciendo representaci&oacute;n en conversaciones sobre quejas cuando se niega la solicitud para una acomodaci&oacute;n y consultando con los empleadores sobre cambios en las pol&iacute;ticas de empleo. Los sindicatos tambi&eacute;n ofrecen informaci&oacute;n sobre los derechos de los empleados con discapacidades.</p>  </div>  <h2>9) Utilice sus programas de gerencia sobre deshabilidad y diversidad como soporte para dar cumplimiento con la ADA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las personas que respondieron a esta encuesta indicaron que uno de los temas en que se logr&oacute; el mayor esfuerzo para llevar a cabo los cambios relacionados a la ADA, fue sobre las actitudes de colegas y supervisores hacia las personas discapacitadas. Esto tambi&eacute;n se considera como uno de los temas m&aacute;s dif&iacute;ciles de cambiar. La informaci&oacute;n recibida de los miembros de la SHRM sugiri&oacute; que los temas sobre las actitudes siguen siendo un problema para las personas discapacitadas en el lugar de trabajo y que se deben seguir reconociendo las barreras relacionadas con estas actitudes. Los programas de diversidad pueden ser un tema en que se puede llevar a cabo el entrenamiento acerca de la sensibilidad hacia la discapacidad o los programas de conscientizaci&oacute;n sobre la misma. De igual manera el hacer &eacute;nfasis en la obligaci&oacute;n que tiene la organizaci&oacute;n en la contrataci&oacute;n y en la retenci&oacute;n de las personas con deshabilidades en la fuerza laboral, as&iacute; como en el conocimiento sobre la manera m&aacute;s adecuada de interactuar con estas personas, puede ser de ayuda en el momento de tratar con los temas relacionados con las actitudes hacia las personas con discapacidades en el lugar de trabajo.</p>  <p>Si su organizaci&oacute;n cuenta con programas de administraci&oacute;n sobre discapacidad o de reintegraci&oacute;n al empleo, &eacute;stos pueden ser un &aacute;rea en la que se apoye el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA. La estructura y los requisitos de estos programas se prestan para promover la importancia de la confidencialidad, el incrementando de la aceptaci&oacute;n de las personas con discapacidades en el lugar de trabajo, el aumentando en el grado de conocimiento de los supervisores acerca de los requisitos para realizar acomodaciones razonables, as&iacute; como para crear una estructura organizacional en la que se puedan llevar a cabo dichas acomodaciones. Tambi&eacute;n fue demostrado por el estudio de Cornell y de los miembros de SHRM, que el valor de este tipo de programas de gerencia sobre deshabilidad est&aacute; en su apoyo a la buena pr&aacute;ctica de las normas de la ADA.</p>  </div>  <h2>10) Utilice los recursos internos y de la comunidad para tratar las necesidades de las acomodaciones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hay muchas personas que por su funci&oacute;n o experiencia particular, deber&iacute;an ser identificadas y contactadas en el proceso general de acomodaci&oacute;n de la organizaci&oacute;n. Aunque la decisi&oacute;n sobre cierta acomodaci&oacute;n es relativa a una persona, su discapacidad y la naturaleza del cargo, existen muchos recursos que se pueden utilizar para cada situaci&oacute;n en particular. Algunos de los expertos &uacute;tiles en la definici&oacute;n de cu&aacute;l es la acomodaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s apropiada con respecto a cierta discapacidad, pueden ser los ergonomistas, fisioterapeutas, terapeutas ocupacionales, especialistas en salud y seguridad, y los especialistas en la asistencia a los empleados. Con frecuencia estas personas trabajan en organizaciones de mayor tama&ntilde;o y su gran experiencia puede ser aplicada al proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n cuando sea necesario. Adem&aacute;s, los especialistas en beneficios y los representantes de relaciones laborales pueden ser de utilidad en cuanto a una solicitud sobre una acomodaci&oacute;n en particular. Identificar a estos individuos y reunirlos peri&oacute;dicamente para construir un sentido de conveniencia cultural de la acomodaci&oacute;n y de la importancia de trabajar en conjunto para generar resultados positivos es una parte primordial de un proceso efic&aacute;z de acomodaci&oacute;n efectiva dentro de la organizaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Adem&aacute;s de los recursos identificados anteriormente los cuales se pueden ser encontrados dentro de cualquier empresa de tama&ntilde;o mediano o grande, existen muchos otros recursos que pueden servir en el proceso de clarificaci&oacute;n y de identificaci&oacute;n de las acomodaciones para personas con ciertas discapacidades. Las agencias estatales de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional que cuentan con consejeros vocacionales que pueden ser &uacute;tiles y en algunos casos pueden ayudar en los asuntos de acomodaciones con costos superiores a los recursos del empleador o con las necesidades espec&iacute;ficas del ambiente laboral. Adem&aacute;s, los Centros Comunitarios de Asistencia para la Vida Independiente pueden ser &uacute;tiles en cuanto a responder preguntas sobre acomodaciones relacionadas a la accesibilidad a un establecimiento, sobre tecnolog&iacute;a especializada, as&iacute; como sobre ayuda en necesidades personales de vivienda o transporte. Muchas de estas organizaciones est&aacute;n listadas en los directorios telef&oacute;nicos de las p&aacute;ginas amarillas.</p>  </div>  <h2>Conclusi&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La implementaci&oacute;n de las normas de la ADA en su organizaci&oacute;n puede tomar alg&uacute;n tiempo y esfuerzo, pero tomar una acci&oacute;n proyectada al futuro de c&oacute;mo desarrollar sus planes ser&aacute; mucho m&aacute;s eficaz que reaccionar m&aacute;s tarde con respecto a asuntos o problemas espec&iacute;ficos. Usted puede asumir una posici&oacute;n cautelosa, abierta o visionaria. Si los empleadores son sensitivos y est&aacute;n de acuerdo con el programa de la ADA con su filosof&iacute;a y su plan de implementaci&oacute;n se va a comenzar a ver una mejor&iacute;a en cuanto al proceso de garantizar la igualdad en la oportunidad de empleo para ciertas personas, incluyendo las personas con discapacidades.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Susanne M.

La A.D.A. divide las relaciones de empleo en tres etapas distintas: previa a la oferta del cargo, posterior a la oferta del cargo y durante el desempe&ntilde;o en el mismo, estableciendo lo que un empleador puede hacer en cada etapa. Este folleto esta enfocado en lo que un empleador puede hacer durante la etapa de desempe&ntilde;o, es decir una vez que el empleado haya sido contratado y est&eacute; trabajando.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Puede el empleador exigir que el empleado se haga un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico o puede &eacute;ste hacer indagaciones relacionadas a deshabilidades&iquest;</b></p>  <p>Un empleador podr&aacute; solicitar un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico o hacer una pregunta relacionada a la deshabilidad, mientras que la indagaci&oacute;n o el ex&aacute;men est&eacute;n relacionados con el empleo y de acuerdo con las necesidades del negocio. Cualquier tipo de informaci&oacute;n obtenida de la indagaci&oacute;n o ex&aacute;men realizados, as&iacute; como cualquier informaci&oacute;n ofrecida voluntariamente por un empleado, debe considerar como un expediente m&eacute;dico confidencial.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Las disposiciones de la A.D.A. sobre ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos y indagaciones sobre deshabilidades pueden aplicarse a todos los empleados?</b></p>  <p>S&iacute;. Las restricciones de la A.D.A. sobre indagaciones y ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos se aplican a todos los empleados cuyos empleadores est&aacute;n amparados bajo esta ley y no solamente a aquellos con deshabilidades. A&uacute;n cuando otras protecciones de la A.D.A. se limiten a aquellos individuos que pueden demostrar ser individuos calificados con deshabilidades, el lenguaje utilizado en la A.D.A. aclara que los empleadores no pueden hacer preguntas o llevar a cabo ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos sobre cualquier empleado a menos que exista una raz&oacute;n leg&iacute;tima para hacerlo. Con base en este lenguaje, la Comisi&oacute;n de Estados Unidos sobre Igualdad de Oportunidades en el empleo (EEOC) ha tomado la posici&oacute;n que cualquier empleado tiene el derecho de rechazar una indagaci&oacute;n relacionada con deshabilidad un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico que no est&eacute; relacionado con el empleo y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresas.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Qu&eacute; sucede con los trabajadores temporales?</b></p>  <p>En t&eacute;rminos generales un individuo se puede considerar un empleado si una entidad controla los medios y la forma de su desempe&ntilde;o. Frecuentemente un empleado temporal es tanto un empleado de la agencia temporal de colocaciones como del empleador al cual ha sido asignado. Como empleadores, la agencia de colocaciones y el empleador temporal pueden hacer preguntas con relaci&oacute;n a deshabilidades y requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos solamente si est&aacute;n relacionados al empleo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  </div>  <h2>Indagaciones relacionadas a la Deshabilidad y Ex&aacute;menes M&eacute;dicos</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p><b>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es exactamente una indagaci&oacute;n relacionada con deshabilidad?</b></p>  <p>Una indagaci&oacute;n relacionada con deshabilidad es aquella pregunta ( o serie de preguntas) que probablemente buscan obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre deshabilidades. Esta podr&iacute;a incluir preguntas directas sobre deshabilidad, tales como: si la persona tiene o ha tenido alguna ves una deshabilidad, de qu&eacute; manera ha obtenido esta condici&oacute;n, o indagar sobre detalles acerca de la naturaleza o severidad de la deshabilidad. Adem&aacute;s, las preguntas sobre informaci&oacute;n gen&szlig;tica, antecedentes previos de la historia de compensaci&oacute;n de los trabajadores, medicamentos recetados anterior o actualmente, o extensas indagaciones sobre problemas m&eacute;dicos (por ejemplo, preguntar :&ldquo;Cu&eacute;nteme todos los problemas de salud que usted tiene&rdquo;) estar&iacute;an tambi&szlig;n restringidas por que probablemente est&aacute;n dirigidas a obtener informaci&oacute;n sobre la deshabilidad. Restricciones en este tipo de indagaciones aplican tanto para las preguntas hechas a la persona, como a las preguntas hechas a una tercera parte, como por ejemplo a un compa&ntilde;ero de trabajo o a un doctor. Se debe tener en cuenta que las preguntas acerca del uso ilegal de drogas o bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas, no se consideran preguntas relacionadas con la deshabilidad.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Acaso &eacute;sto significa que no puedo ni preguntarle a alguien &ldquo;c&oacute;mo est&aacute;?&rdquo;</b></p>  <p>Es aceptable hacer preguntas generales sobre el bienestar de un empleado. Por ejemplo, es perfectamente razonable preguntarle a un empleado que parece cansado o enfermo si se siente bien, o preguntarle a un empleado como se siente despu&eacute;s de un divorcio o la p&eacute;rdida de un ser querido. De la misma manera es aceptable preguntar sobre limitaciones no relacionadas a deshabilidad (por ejemplo, :&ldquo;&iquest;C&oacute;mo se fractur&oacute; la mu&ntilde;eca?&rdquo;), o preguntarle a una empleada embarazada como se siente o cu&aacute;ndo espera dar a la luz. Tambi&eacute;n es aceptable preguntarle a un empleado simplemente si puede desempe&ntilde;arse en este trabajo. Adem&aacute;s, si es el empleado quien hace los comentarios relacionados con la deshabilidad, podr&iacute;a ser aceptado que el empleador discuta este asunto con &eacute;l o ella.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Cuando hablamos de &ldquo;ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico&rdquo;, acaso &eacute;sto implica un ex&aacute;men f&iacute;sico completo de pies a cabeza? </b></p>  <p>Un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico incluye un chequeo f&iacute;sico completo; pero este t&eacute;rmino de acuerdo a su utilizaci&oacute;n en la A.D.A. incluye tambi&eacute;n una serie de otros ex&aacute;menes o procedimientos m&aacute;s limitados. En t&eacute;rminos generales, un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico es un procedimiento o prueba que busca informaci&oacute;n sobre la salud f&iacute;sica o mental de un individuo. Hay varios factores que hacen que una prueba sea m&eacute;dica, como por ejemplo: si un profesional de la salud lleva a cabo o interpreta una prueba, si la prueba est&aacute; dise&ntilde;ada para revelar un impedimento o un problema de salud f&iacute;sica o mental en general; si la prueba mide la habilidad para desempe&ntilde;ar una tarea o por el contrario busca una respuesta fisiol&oacute;gica para el desempe&ntilde;o de la funci&oacute;n; o si la prueba es invasiva, utiliza equipos m&eacute;dicos, o se lleva a cabo en un ambiente m&eacute;dico. A veces unos de estos factores son suficientes para que un procedimiento se considere m&eacute;dico. Otras veces la combinaci&oacute;n de factores puede ser importante. En general los ex&aacute;menes m&szlig;dicos pueden incluir:</p>  <p>- Un ex&aacute;men f&iacute;sico completo o parcial (por ejemplo solamente de la espalda) llevado a cabo por un doctor u otro profesional de la salud</p>  <p>- ex&aacute;menes de la visi&oacute;n llevados a cabo o analizados por un oftalm&oacute;logo o un opt&oacute;metra</p>  <p>- pruebas de sangre, orina y del aliento para dedectar el uso de bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas</p>  <p>- an&aacute;lisis de la sangre, orina, saliva y cabello para determinar enfermedades o rasgos gen&eacute;ticos</p>  <p>- evaluaci&oacute;n de la tensi&oacute;n arterial y del colesterol</p>  <p>- pruebas sobre la conducci&oacute;n nerviosa</p>  <p>- pruebas sobre la amplitud del movimiento que mide la fuerza y la funci&oacute;n muscular</p>  <p>- pruebas de funci&oacute;n pulmonar</p>  <p>- pruebas psicol&oacute;gicas dise&ntilde;adas para medir un desorden o una limitaci&oacute;n mental</p>  <p>- procedimientos diagn&oacute;sticos como radiograf&iacute;as, tomograf&iacute;as y resonancias magn&eacute;ticas</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Cu&aacute;les son algunas de las pruebas de empleo com&uacute;nmente utilizadas que no se consideran ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos?</b></p>  <p>Hay varias pruebas y procedimientos proporcionados por los empleadores, que no se consideran de tipo m&eacute;dico, como por ejemplo:</p>  <p>- pruebas para determinar el uso ilegal de drogas</p>  <p>- pruebas sobre agilidad f&iacute;sica, que miden la habilidad de un empleado de llevar a cabo tareas espec&iacute;ficas del trabajo, reales o simuladas</p>  <p>- pruebas de condici&oacute;n f&iacute;sica que miden el desempe&ntilde;o de un empleado en ejercicios f&iacute;sicos, como puede ser correr o levantar algo, siempre y cuando estas pruebas no incluyan un componente m&eacute;dico como la medici&oacute;n del ritmo cardi&aacute;co o de la tensi&oacute;n arterial</p>  <p>- pruebas que miden la habilidad de leer etiquetas o de distinguir objetos como parte de una demostraci&oacute;n de la habilidad de desempe&ntilde;ar funciones reales del trabajo</p>  <p>- pruebas psicol&oacute;gicas que miden rasgos de la personalidad como la honestidad, las preferencias personales, o los h&aacute;bitos</p>  <p>- ex&aacute;menes de pol&iacute;grafo</p>  <p><b>&iquest;C&oacute;mo deber&iacute;a un empleador tratar a un empleado que solicite un nuevo cargo dentro de la empresa?</b></p>  <p>La EEOC opina que un empleador deber&iacute;a tratar un empleado quien solicita un nuevo cargo tal como si fuera un solicitante externo. Esto significa que un empleador no puede hacer preguntas con relaci&oacute;n a deshabilidad o requerir un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico antes de haber hecho una oferta condicional de trabajo para el nuevo cargo. Un supervisor actual que tenga informaci&oacute;n de tipo m&eacute;dico sobre el empleado, no deber&aacute; revelar esta informaci&oacute;n a la persona encargada de llevar a cabo la entrevista de trabajo para el nuevo cargo, ni al nuevo supervisor.</p>  <p>Una vez se haya hecho una oferta condicional de trabajo, el empleador puede requerir un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico o hacer preguntas con relaci&oacute;n a deshabilidad, siempre y cuando lo haga para todos los nuevos empleados en la misma categor&iacute;a de empleo. Si posteriormente se retracta la oferta de trabajo debido a informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, el empleador debe demostrar que la raz&oacute;n de esta decisi&oacute;n est&aacute; relacionada con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p>Un individuo no se considera un aplicante cuando &eacute;l o ella no est&eacute;n calificados para desempe&ntilde;ar otro cargo con el mismo empleador (por ejemplo, debido a su antig&uuml;edad en el cargo o a su buen desempe&ntilde;o en el mismo). Un individuo que est&aacute; asignado temporalmente a otro cargo y luego regresa a su trabajo regular, tampoco se considera un / a solicitante. Siendo considerados estos individuos como empleados, el empleador puede hacer preguntas con relaci&oacute;n a deshabilidad o requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos solamente si &eacute;stas est&aacute;n relacionadas al trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  </div>  <h2>Relacionados con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p><b>&iquest;Qu&eacute; significa la expresi&oacute;n &ldquo;relacionado con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa&rdquo;?</b></p>  <p>La EEOC considera que una indagaci&oacute;n relacionada con deshabilidad o un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico podr&iacute;an estar &ldquo;relacionados con el trabajo y ser consistente con las necesidades de la empresa&rdquo;, cuando un empleador tiene una convicci&oacute;n razonable, basada en evidencia objetiva de que: (1) La habilidad de un empleado de ejercer las funciones del cargo se ver&iacute;a perjudicada por una condici&oacute;n de salud, o (2) que un empleado / a constituye una amenaza directa debido a su condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica. Este par&aacute;metro se aplica en el caso en que el empleador sepa acerca de una condici&oacute;n de salud espec&iacute;fica del empleado, haya observado problemas en el desempeo del trabajo y pueda atribuir estos problemas al estado de salud del empleado. Este par&aacute;metro se puede aplicar tambi&eacute;n cuando el empleador haya recibido informaci&oacute;n confiable por parte de una tercera persona de que el empleador presenta un problema de salud; o cuando el empleador haya observado s&iacute;ntomas que ind&iacute;quen que la persona puede tener un problema de salud que la limita en su habilidad para desempe&ntilde;arse en sus funciones esenciales o constituya una amenaza directa.</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: El trabajo desempe&ntilde;ado por un chofer de una gr&uacute;a hidr&aacute;ulica es el de transportar y almacenar tarimas que pesan varios cientos hasta miles de libras, en una bodega de almacenamiento con numerosos empleados trabajando en el &aacute;rea. Despu&eacute;s de diez a&ntilde;os de carrera impecable, este chofer de la gr&uacute;a hidr&aacute;ulica se choca contra una pared de tarimas almacenadas, esquivando por suerte a uno de sus compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo. El empleado explica que se sinti&oacute; mareado y desorientado y que &eacute;sto ya le hab&iacute;a sucedido anteriormente pero nunca durante su trabajo. El empleador puede considera entonces que este empleado constituye una amenaza directa y puede envierlo a realizarse un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico para determinar si est&aacute; en condiciones de desempe&ntilde;arse en su trabajo. El empleador le explica al doctor el perfil del trabajo para ayudarlo a asegurar un diagn&oacute;stico m&aacute;s preciso. En este caso el ex&aacute;men se considerar&iacute;a relacionado con el trabajo y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: Hace algunos meses, un supervisor escuch&oacute; a dos trabajadores hablando acerca de otro colega quien les hab&iacute;a comentado que ten&iacute;a una condici&oacute;n cardi&aacute;ca grave que requer&iacute;a el uso de medicinas y frecuentes visitas al doctor. El individuo viene al trabajo todos los d&iacute;as y desempe&ntilde;a sus funciones exitosamente como programador de sistemas. En este caso, el trabajador no tiene una prueba razonable acerca de la incapacidad del programador de sistemas de desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales de su trabajo, o que constituya una amenaza directa debido a su problema de salud. El empleador no podr&iacute;a indagar acerca de la deshabilidad o requerir un examen m&iacute;dico en este caso.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Las indagaciones sobre deshabilidad o los ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos consecuentes a una petici&oacute;n de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable se consideran relacionados con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa? </b></p>  <p>Cuando un empleado solicita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable y la deshabilidad o la necesidad de esta acomodaci&oacute;n razonable no son evidentes, se considera relacionado con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa que el empleador le solicite a un empleado proveer la documentaci&oacute;n suficiente sobre su deshabilidad y las limitaciones funcionales que requieren de dicha acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Un empleador puede requerir que un empleado presente una documentaci&oacute;n que sea suficiente para sustentar que &eacute;l / ella tiene una deshabilidad sobre la base de las regulaciones de la A.D.A. y que necesita la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable pedida anteriormente. La documentaci&oacute;n se considera suficiente si (1) describe la naturaleza, severidad y duraci&oacute;n de la discapacidad del empleado; la actividad o actividades que esta discapacidad impide realizar y en qu&eacute; medida esta discapacidad limita al empleado en desempe&ntilde;ar dichas actividades; (2) sustenta la raz&oacute;n por la cual la acomodaci&oacute;n requerida es necesaria para permitir al empleado desempe&ntilde;arse en las funciones esenciales de su cargo.</p>  <p>Se debe observar que un empleador no puede pedir documentaci&oacute;n que no est&eacute; relacionada con el asunto. La consecuencia pr&aacute;ctica de &eacute;sto es que un empleador, generalmente no puede solicitar expedientes m&eacute;dicos completos por que &eacute;stos pueden contener informaci&oacute;n que no est&eacute; relacionada con el asunto</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: Una secretaria con una deshabilidad no evidente solicita una silla ergon&oacute;mica por causa de un dolor de la espalda. El empleador podr&iacute;a solicitarle a la empleada la documentaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica que: (1) describa la naturaleza, severidad y duraci&oacute;n de la discapacidad la empleada; la actividad o actividades que esta discapacidad le impide realizar y en qu&eacute; medida esta discapacidad limita a la empleada en desempe&ntilde;arse en dichas actividades; (2) sustentar la razon por la cual necesita la silla ergon&oacute;mica.

Sin embargo, se le debe dar primero la oportunidad al empleado de presentar la documentaci&oacute;n que hace falta.</p>  <p>La posici&oacute;n de la EEOC limita y sujeta a objeci&oacute;n las circunstancias en las cuales un empleador puede requerir un ex&aacute;men llevado a cabo por su propio doctor. Aun que el empleado tenga la responsabilidad inicial de proveer las pruebas que sustenten su solicitud de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, podr&iacute;a ser tambi&eacute;n discutido que el empleador tenga pleno derecho de solicitar una segunda opini&oacute;n, o buscar informaci&oacute;n adicional cuando &eacute;l lo considere necesario. Sin embargo, consistente con esta posici&oacute;n, la EEOC ha especificado claramente que si la solicitud de informaci&oacute;n adicional u otro ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico requerido por parte del empleador est&aacute; basada en la buena fe de que la informaci&oacute;n recibida hasta ahora es insuficiente, esta solicitud no debe ser considerada como una forma de represalia y el empleador no deber&aacute; ser acusado de violaci&oacute;n de las normas de la A.D.A.</p>  <p>La recomendaci&oacute;n de la EEOC es que un empleador deber&iacute;a tambi&eacute;n considerar la posibilidad de obtener el permiso previo del empleado para consultar directamente con su m&eacute;dico, antes de solicitarle al empleado que se dirija al doctor de la preferencia del empleador; &eacute;sta es una buena sugerencia y econ&oacute;micamente efectiva. De manera pr&aacute;ctica el empleador podr&iacute;a solicitar que su doctor se comunique directamente con el de su empleado.</p>  <p>Cualquier ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico practicado por un profesional de la salud escogido por el empleador, debe estar relacionado con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.

La EEOC ha establecido que un empleador podr&aacute; exigir que un empleado al que &eacute;l considera una amenaza directa, sea examinado por un profesional de la salud de su preferencia quien sea experto en el problema de salud espec&iacute;fico del empleado y que pueda proveer informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica que permita al empleador determinar los efectos de esta condici&oacute;n de salud sobre la capacidad del empleado para desempe&ntilde;arse en su trabajo. El ex&aacute;men deber&aacute; estar limitado a determinar si el empleado puede desempe&ntilde;arse en su trabajo sin constituirse en una amenaza directa, con o sin una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. En muchas circunstancias, el empleador no podr&aacute; solicitar los expedientes m&eacute;dicos completos porque &eacute;stos pueden contener informaci&oacute;n no relacionada con el asunto.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <p>El empleador deber&aacute; ser cuidadoso en confiar exclusivamente en las conclusiones de su propio proveedor de la salud, si &eacute;stas contradicen las opiniones del doctor de su empleado. Para evaluar ambas opiniones puede ser &uacute;til que el empleador considere lo siguiente: (1) la experiencia m&eacute;dica de cada uno de los profesionales de la salud en cuesti&oacute;n; (2) qu&eacute; clase de informaci&oacute;n fue otorgada a cada uno de los profesionales m&eacute;dicos, concerniente a las funciones esenciales del cargo y al ambiente de trabajo; (3) si la opini&oacute;n est&aacute; basada en especulaciones o en informaci&oacute;n actual, objetiva y verificable acerca de los riesgos asociados con la condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica espec&iacute;fica; y (4) si la opini&oacute;n m&eacute;dica es contradictoria con la informaci&oacute;n conocida u observada por el empleador (por ejemplo, informaci&oacute;n relacionada con la experiencia real del empleado en su trabajo (s) actual o previo). Recuerde que es finalmente el empleador quien es responsable de la decisi&oacute;n, no el doctor.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Qui&eacute;n paga los gastos cuando un empleado es enviado donde el profesional de la salud escogido por el empleador?</b></p>  <p>La EEOC considera que si un empleador requiere que un empleado vaya a un proveedor de salud de su preferencia, el empleador debe pagar todos los costos asociados con esta (s) visita (s).</p>  <p><b> &iquest;Se puede requerir que todos los empleados reporten sus prescripciones m&eacute;dicas? </b></p>  <p>En general este tipo de indagatorias no est&aacute; permitida.

Si la solicitud de acomodaci&oacute;n fuese un permiso de ausencia del trabajo, el empleador podr&iacute;a negarlo y tambi&eacute;n negarse a justificar las ausencias.</p>  <p>Muchos tribunales podr&iacute;an interpretar la falta de cooperaci&oacute;n del empleado, como una falta de participaci&oacute;n en el proceso interactivo relacionado con la A.D.A, que ayuda a determinar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable efectiva, y probablemente rechazar&iacute;an cualquier otro reclamo de la A.D.A. hecho sobre estas bases.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;C&oacute;mo se pueden asegurar los empleadores de que los empleados pueden someterse a pruebas de agilidad y resistencia f&iacute;sica sin riesgo alguno?</b></p>  <p>Los empleadores que requieren pruebas de agilidad y resistencia f&iacute;sica pueden preguntarle a su empleado si tiene un doctor certificado que pueda realizarle la prueba sin riesgo alguno. El empleador tendr&aacute; derecho a recibir simplemente un reporte que declare que la persona puede someterse a la prueba sin ning&uacute;n riesgo; o por otra parte, una explicaci&oacute;n del por qu&eacute; no puede someterse a la prueba.

Si la solicitud de licencia del empleado no especifica una fecha exacta o aproximada de retorno, o si se solicita una extensi&oacute;n de la licencia, el empleador podr&iacute;a requerir que el empleado env&iacute;e reportes peri&oacute;dicos de su condici&oacute;n de salud y en lo posible una fecha de regreso al trabajo. Sin embargo, hay que anotar que cuando un empleador ha aprobado una duraci&oacute;n de licencia fija y no le sea solicitada alguna extensi&oacute;n de la misma, la EEOC considera que podr&iacute;a ser permisible requerir reportes peri&oacute;dicos de actualizaci&oacute;n. Un empleador puede siempre comunicarse con su empleado quien tenga una licencia prolongada para expresarle su preocupaci&oacute;n sobre su estado de salud y para indagar sobre su progreso.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Est&aacute;n permitidos los documentos o los ex&aacute;menes para el reintegro al trabajo?</b></p>  <p>Cuando un empleado ha estado en licencia el empleador puede requerir un certificado de regreso al trabajo expedido por el m&eacute;dico tratante, o requerir un ex&aacute;men de reintegro al trabajo, siempre y cuando el trabajador tenga un argumento razonable de que la capacidad del empleado para desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones del cargo est&aacute; limitada por su condici&oacute;n de salud, o que &eacute;l / ella constituye una amenaza directa debida a la misma condici&oacute;n. Usualmente, s&oacute;lo se requiere una indagatoria o un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico que est&eacute;n relacionados a la condici&oacute;n por la cual el trabajador tuvo que solicitar la licencia.</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: Un abogado se fractura la pierna esquiando y pide una licencia para ausentarse de su trabajo por cuatro semanas. &Eacute;l regresa al trabajo usando muletas. El empleador no tiene un argumento razonable de que el abogado estar&aacute; incapacitado para desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales de su cargo o que constituya una amenaza directa debido a la lesi&oacute;n recibida. El empleador no puede en este caso hacer relacionadas con la deshabilidad o requerir un examen m&eacute;dico, pero podr&iacute;a preguntarle a la persona c&oacute;mo esta o expresar inter&eacute;s por su estado de salud.</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: Como resultado de problemas con sus medicamentos, un empleado con conocidos problemas psiqui&aacute;tricos amenaza a varios de sus compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo y es sancionado disciplinariamente.

Dos d&iacute;as m&aacute;s tarde &eacute;l es dado de alta en el hospital y retorna al trabajo con un certificado que declara que &ldquo;&eacute;l est&aacute; en condici&oacute;n de regresar a su trabajo&rdquo;. Pero debido a que el empleador tiene una raz&oacute;n l&oacute;gica, basada en evidencia objetiva de que el empleado puede ser una amenaza directa debido a su condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, el empleador puede solicitarle al empleado documentos adicionales con respecto a su medicaci&oacute;n o tratamiento, y requerir que &eacute;l se someta a un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Qu&eacute; sucede con las licencia solicitadas bajo la FMLA?</b></p>  <p>La FMLA, implementada por el Departamento de Trabajo, establece sus propios requisitos tanto para empleadores como para empleados en relaci&oacute;n con las licencias. La EEOC ha declarado que cuando un empleado solicite una licencia bajo la FMLA debido a una grave condici&oacute;n de salud, los empleadores no infrigir&iacute;an las normas de la A.D.A. al preguntar informaci&oacute;n en la certificaci&oacute;n de la FMLA. La FMLA solamente requiere informaci&oacute;n relacionada con la condici&oacute;n de salud espec&iacute;fica, tal y como es definida en la FMLA, como causa por la cual el empleado est&aacute; solicitando la licencia. Un empleador est&aacute; autorizado a saber por qu&eacute; un empleado est&aacute; solicitando permiso para ausentarse del trabajo bajo la FMLA. Si las indagaciones son precisamente dirigidas de esta manera, estar&iacute;an relacionadas con el trabajo y de consistentes con las necesidades de la empresa bajo lo estipulado por la A.D.A.</p>  </div>  <h2>Peri&oacute;do de Monitoreo</h2>  <div class=\"\"section\"\">  <p><b>&iquest;Pueden los empleadores requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos peri&oacute;dicos de empleados cuyos cargos afectan la seguridad p&uacute;blica?</b></p>  <p>S&iacute;.

El empleador necesitar&iacute;a considerar los riesgos de la seguridad asociada con el cargo, las consequencias de la inhabilidad del empleador de desempe&ntilde;ar adecuadamente sus funciones y c&oacute;mo eventos ocurridos recientemente hacen creer al empleador que el empleado es una amenaza directa. En el momento en que el empleado obtenga varias veces un resultado negativo en las pruebas del uso de alc&oacute;hol, continuar someti&eacute;ndolo a ellas no estar&iacute;a relacionado con el trabajo ni ser&iacute;a consistente con las necesidades de la empresa, porque el empleador no tendr&iacute;a en este caso un argumento razonable de que el empleado es una amenaza directa.</p>  <p><b>Ejemplo</b>: Un conductor de autob&uacute;s informa a su supervisor que &eacute;l ha tenido un historial de alcoholismo y que despu&eacute;s de varios a&ntilde;os de sobriedad ha empezado a ingerir un par de copas de vino en las noches para tratar con situaciones familiares que le son estresantes. &Eacute;l solicita y le es otorgada una licencia para entrar a un programa de rehabilitaci&oacute;n. Despu&eacute;s de cuatro meses, &eacute;l es declarado apto para regresar a su trabajo. Dados los riesgos de seguridad asociados con su cargo, su corto periodo en el empleo, y su reciente culminaci&oacute;n en el programa de rehabilitaci&oacute;n; el empleador podr&iacute;a demostrar que someter al conductor a pruebas peri&oacute;dicas del uso de alcohol posteriores a su retorno al trabajo, est&aacute;n relacionadas con el trabajo y de acuerdo con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p>Los empleadores tambi&eacute;n pueden solicitar pruebas peri&oacute;dicas del uso de alcohol basadas en una &ldquo;&uacute;ltima oportunidad&rdquo; de un acuerdo de acciones disciplinarias que est&eacute;n relacionadas con el consumo de alcohol por parte del empleado.

La EEOC establece que la ADA no proh&iacute;be a un empleador o a su representante (por ejemplo los agentes para la compensaci&oacute;n de los trabajadores) hacer preguntas relacionadas con la deshabilidad o requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos que sean necesarios para determinar el alcance legal de la responsabilidad para la compensaci&oacute;n del empleado. Sin embargo, dichas indagaciones o ex&aacute;menes deben estar limitados exclusivamente a la lesi&oacute;n ocurrida en el lugar de trabajo y a su impacto en el individuo y no se deber&aacute; solicitar m&aacute;s de lo regularmente necesario para determinar que la calificaci&oacute;n inicial o prolongada de la persona para recibir los beneficios del programa de compensaci&oacute;n de los trabajadores.</p>  <p><b>&iquest;Podr&iacute;a un empleador solicitar a un(a) empleado (a) que voluntariamente se identifique como una persona que tiene una deshabilidad para fines de un programa de Acci&oacute;n Afirmativa?</b></p>  <p>S&iacute;. Un empleador podr&aacute; solicitar a sus empleados que voluntariamente se auto-identifiquen como individuos con deshabilidades cuando el empleador est&eacute;:</p>  <p>* Llevando a cabo un programa de acci&oacute;n afirmativa debido a una ley federal o local (incluyendo la ley de preferencia a los veteranos de guerra), requiera de este tipo de programas para individuos con deshabilidades; o.</p>  <p>* Cuando use la informaci&oacute;n voluntariamente para el beneficio de las personas con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>La Gu&iacute;a sobre el Cumplimiento de Indagaciones Relacionadas con la Deshabilidad y ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos de la EEOC establece otros requisitos detallados para empleadores quienes inviten a sus empleados a identificarse en cualquiera de estas dos situaciones.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Sheila D.

Debido a que la ADA cubre todo aspectos relacionados con la participaci&oacute;n del individuo en la sociedad tales como el empleo, las acomodaciones p&uacute;blicas, el transporte y las telecomunicaciones, el impacto de esta ley afecta a las empresas de varias formas. Las empresas est&aacute;n cubiertas por las normas de la ADA en su funci&oacute;n como empleadores as&iacute; como entidades que ofrecen bienes y servicios. Por este motivo es importante que cada empresa le ofrezca a sus empleados acceso a la informaci&oacute;n apropiada y al entrenamiento del personal con respecto a los requisitos de la ADA, su importancia en cuanto al funcionamiento total de la empresa, y las responsabilidades de ciertos miembros del personal.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Cu&aacute;les empleados del personal en la empresa deber&iacute;an recibir entrenamiento sobre la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>R: El impacto de la ADA es muy extenso. Toda persona en la empresa deber&iacute;a encontrar informaci&oacute;n y entrenamiento sobre la ADA con informaci&oacute;n relevante relacionada con su trabajo. En general, la informaci&oacute;n sobre la ADA podr&iacute;a ser muy &uacute;til para todos los empleados, ya que les deja saber sobre sus derechos y obligaciones bajo las normas de esta ley.</p>  <p>En el oto&ntilde;o de 1988 la Sociedad para la administraci&oacute;n de recursos humanos (SHRM) en conjunto con la Universidad de Cornell realizaron una encuesta dirigida a los miembros de esta organizaci&oacute;n<sup>1</sup>. El objetivo de esta encuesta fue evaluar el impacto de la ADA con respecto a las pr&aacute;cticas del Departamento de Recursos Humanos desde el momento en que esta ley entr&oacute; en vigor, y uno de los temas cubiertos fue el entrenamiento sobre la ADA. En la encuesta se le pregunta a los participantes si los empleados de la empresa fueron entrenados en diferentes temas relacionados con la ADA, incluyendo: el reclutamiento y contrataci&oacute;n sin discriminaci&oacute;n, el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n, tener la misma posibilidad de acceso a oportunidades de ascenso o entrenamiento, acomodaci&oacute;n por problemas de salud mental, definici&oacute;n de las funciones esenciales del cargo, requisitos de confidencialidad con respecto a la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, las limitaciones y exclusiones autorizadas por la ADA y otras leyes federales con respecto a los planes de salud, la ausencia de discriminaci&oacute;n en el proceso de aplicar las medidas de disciplina con respecto a los empleados o su despido, resoluci&oacute;n de conflictos en el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n, fomento del entendimiento sobre discapacidades o ofreciendo un entrenamiento para aumentar la sensitividad sobre estos dem&aacute;s, y la interacci&oacute;n con otras leyes estatales y federales. En casi la mayor&iacute;a de estos temas m&aacute;s de la mitad de las personas encuestadas (813 miembros de la SHRM participaron en la encuesta) indicaron que sus empleados fueron entrenados.</p>  <p>Los empleadores deben decidir la mejor forma de entrenar a su personal para que se beneficie con el entrenamiento sobre la ADA, para asegurarse que sus medidas est&aacute;n de acuerdo con las normas de la ADA, y que le est&aacute;n respondiendo apropiadamente a las personas con deshabilidades. Aunque todo empleado deber&iacute;a recibir alg&uacute;n tipo de entrenamiento, ciertos miembros del personal deber&iacute;an ser considerados para recibir un entrenamiento m&aacute;s especializado. Estos profesionales incluyen: el personal encargado de llevar a cabo el entrenamiento y la capacitaci&oacute;n del empleado; especialistas en recursos humanos encargados de la capacitaci&oacute;n; administraci&oacute;n de nivel alto; a nivel intermedio; supervisores del trabajo en l&iacute;nea; operarios; l&iacute;deres sindicales y representantes del campo; personal del departamento de beneficios y compensaci&oacute;n; personal encargado de la seguridad y la protecci&oacute;n del medio ambiente; Personal de reclutamiento y entrevista de candidatos; psic&oacute;logos industriales, organizacionales u otro personal encargado de la evaluaci&oacute;n de pre-empleo; Personal de capacitaci&oacute;n en la organizaci&oacute;n; especialistas en ergonom&iacute;a; supervisores encargados de deshabilidades a corto y largo plazo, personal t&eacute;cnico; representantes del departamento de servicios al cliente, recepcionistas y otros que est&aacute;n en contacto con el p&uacute;blico.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <p><sup>1</sup> La universidad de Cornell recibi&oacute; ayuda financiera para esta investigaci&oacute;n del Instituto Nacional de Deshabilidad e Investigaci&oacute;n en Rehabilitaci&oacute;n (NIDRR) divisi&oacute;n del Departamento Nacional de Educaci&oacute;n de los Estados Unidos como parte del Proyecto de Investigaci&oacute;n y Demostraci&oacute;n (Concesi&oacute;n No. H133A70005).

Informaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s espec&iacute;fica ser&iacute;a de mayor importancia para los empleados en las categor&iacute;as mencionadas anteriormente, cuyas responsabilidades pueden ser afectadas por los requisitos de cierta normas de la ADA en particular. Los siguientes son algunos ejemplos de entrenamiento al personal considerado como esencial para satisfacer las necesidades de informaci&oacute;n a empleados, dependiendo de las funciones de su cargo:</p>  <p>* Conocimiento general de todos los T&iacute;tulos de la ADA</p>  <p>* Conocimiento espec&iacute;fico de las normas de empleo de la ADA</p>  <p>* Conocimiento espec&iacute;fico de las normas para las acomodaciones p&uacute;blicas</p>  <p>* Evaluaciones de pre-empleo y entrevista del candidato bajo las normas de la ADA</p>  <p>* Ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos y otros bajo la ADA</p>  <p>* Relaci&oacute;n entre la ADA y otras leyes estatales y federales sobre el empleo sin discriminaci&oacute;n</p>  <p>* Identificaci&oacute;n de las funciones esenciales del cargo</p>  <p>* Redacci&oacute;n de la descripci&oacute;n del puesto que identifica las funciones esenciales del cargo</p>  <p>* El proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable</p>  <p>* Informaci&oacute;n en general sobre discapacidades espec&iacute;ficas y posibles acomodaciones</p>  <p>* Informaci&oacute;n sobre la Evaluaci&oacute;n del puesto y la compensaci&oacute;n y las personas con deshabilidades</p>  <p>* Igualdad profesional o consideraci&oacute;n en los ascensos para personas con deshabilidades</p>  <p>* Reentrenamiento luego de sufrir la dicapacitaci&oacute;n</p>  <p>* Evaluaciones de desempe&ntilde;o en el puesto sin discriminaci&oacute;n</p>  <p>* Impacto de la ADA en los requisitos de acomodaci&oacute;n en el entrenamiento del personal</p>  <p>* Acceso a la tecnolog&iacute;a inform&aacute;tica en el lugar de trabajo</p>  <p>* Recopilaci&oacute;n de datos o informaci&oacute;n sobre acomodaciones</p>  <p>* Negociaci&oacute;n o resoluci&oacute;n de conflictos en el proceso de acomodaciones razonables</p>  <p>* La necesidad de ofrecer entrenamiento individualizado y / o apoyo profesional en el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable</p>  <p>* Relaciones con el cliente con deshabilidad</p>  <p>Durante el entrenamiento, temas como las acomodaciones espec&iacute;ficas para personas con ciertas deshabilidades pueden ser mejor presentadas al combinar la informaci&oacute;n de un entrenador que est&aacute; familiarizado con las normas de la ADA, con la informaci&oacute;n de un profesional especializado en acomodaciones espec&iacute;ficas para estas personas. Algunos ejemplos de estos profesionales incluyen los ergon&oacute;metras, terapeutas f&iacute;sicos u ocupacionales, consejeros de rehabilitaci&oacute;n, especialistas en apoyo profesional, terapeutas o consejeros de salud mental, del abuso de drogas o de bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas, o ingenieros especializados en la rehabilitaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Otros temas de entrenamiento que no necesariamente est&aacute;n relacionados con los requisitos de la ADA, pero que refuerzan el objetivo de esta ley son: las actitudes de otros hacia las personas con deshabilidades; la deshabilidad como una faceta de la diversidad; medidas administrativas efectivas con respecto a la deshabilidad; prevenci&oacute;n de posibles lesiones aplicando medidas de seguridad en el puesto de trabajo y el reclutamiento efectivo de personas con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>Esta lista no se considera completa pero representa muchos temas importantes que pueden tenerse en cuenta para diseminar efectivamente la informaci&oacute;n y capacitaci&oacute;n al personal sobre las normas de la ADA. El contenido deber&aacute; ser enfocado hacia las responsabilidades espec&iacute;ficas del personal que est&aacute; siendo entrenado. Con el fin de enfocar m&aacute;s eficazmente la informaci&oacute;n relacionada con las acomodaciones para evitar cierto tipo de condiciones deshabilitantes, aspectos tales como: la naturaleza misma del trabajo, el tipo de lesi&oacute;n relacionada al puesto y las deshabilidades m&aacute;s frecuentes que ocurren a cierto tipo de empleados deben ser aspectos considerados durante el entrenamiento.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest; A qu&eacute; nivel de la organizaci&oacute;n se deber&iacute;a iniciar un entrenamiento sobre la ley ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>R: Como lo mencionamos anteriormente, personal a todo nivel de la organizaci&oacute;n se ver&iacute;a beneficiado con la informaci&oacute;n y el entrenamiento sobre la ADA. Las personas que respondieron a la encuesta de la SHRM y de la Universidad de Cornell indicaron que la manera m&aacute;s efectiva de garantizar la reducci&oacute;n de las barreras en el empleo y el ascenso de personas con deshabilidades es mediante un mayor compromiso de la administraci&oacute;n de alto nivel en ofrecer entrenamiento y establecer una pol&iacute;tica de no discriminaci&oacute;n. Es importante que cualquier iniciativa en la diseminaci&oacute;n de una pol&iacute;tica de diversidad y no discriminaci&oacute;n basada en la deshabilidad sea asumida como un compromiso de toda la empresa, para que as&iacute; su impacto sea real.</p>  <p>En empresas de mayor tama&ntilde;o, donde los profesionales del departamento de recursos humanos est&aacute;n primordialmente encargados del reclutamiento de nuevos empleados, de las entrevistas, las evaluaciones de pre-empleo, beneficios, compensaci&oacute;n y el entrenamiento, el departamento de Recursos Humanos puede ser el mejor punto de enfoque para concentrar inicialmente los esfuerzos de diseminaci&oacute;n y de entrenamiento. Tambi&eacute;n ser&iacute;a bueno extender este entrenamiento al empleado, as&iacute; como al departamento de personal.</p>  <p>En empresas de mayor tama&ntilde;o el siguiente entrenamiento deber&aacute; ser el de los supervisores (&eacute;ste podr&iacute;a ser ofrecido antes que en empresas m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;as.) Algunos de los temas de las previsiones de empleo que pueden ser dirigidas a las necesidades de informaci&oacute;n de los supervisores, son: las evaluaciones de pre-empleo y los requisitos de la ADA; ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos, de drogas y otros ex&aacute;menes; redacci&oacute;n de las descripciones del puesto con las funciones esenciales del cargo; el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable; Expectativas del desempleo y la persona con deshabilidad; e igualdad en el acceso para personas con deshabilidades a programas de entrenamiento del personal y a las oportunidades de promoci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Cu&aacute;les son los factores que deben considerarse para garantizar la accesibilidad al entrenamiento para personas con deshabilidades?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">R: Las previsiones de empleo indican que ning&uacute;n empleador puede discriminar contra una persona calificada con una deshabilidad con relaci&oacute;n al entrenamiento en el trabajo. Esto significa que los entrenadores del personal, para cumplir con las necesidades de acomodaci&oacute;n de la persona deshabilitada que est&aacute; siendo entrenada, est&aacute;n en la obligaci&oacute;n de ofrecer una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable a menos que &eacute;sta constituya un costo excesivo. Algunos ejemplos de posibles modificaciones pueden incluir:  <p>* Reestructurando o simplificando los formatos de los entrenamientos para acomodar a las personas con limitaciones cognoscitivas que est&aacute;n siendo entrenadas</p>  <p>* Garantizando que los sitios de entrenamiento sean accesibles para personas que se movilizan en silla de ruedas</p>  <p>* Conversi&oacute;n de material por escrito al formato de Braille o cintas de audio</p>  <p>* Ofreciendo un int&eacute;rprete de signos o un lector</p>  <p>* Usando el formato de subt&iacute;tulos en cintas de video para personas sordas</p>  <p>* Siendo consciente sobre irritantes ambientales para aquellas personas en entrenamiento que pueden tener sensibilidad a los productos qu&iacute;micos</p>  <p>* Defendiendo los derechos de una persona siendo entrenada, cuando &eacute;ste entrenamiento se lleva a cabo en otro sitio y cierta persona necesita la acomodaci&oacute;n</p>  <p>Los entrenadores pueden considerar el uso de tecnolog&iacute;as inform&aacute;ticas u otras formas de aprendizaje a distancia que se est&aacute;n utilizando con mayor frecuencia en los entrenamientos del personal. Esto puede ser un recurso efectivo para el acceso f&aacute;cil y rentable al entrenamiento, permitiendo que el usuario tenga acceso al sal&oacute;n de clase desde su propia oficina u hogar. Sin embargo, la transformaci&oacute;n del Internet de un formato basado en texto a un ambiente multi-media robusto, ha creado una limitaci&oacute;n creciente en cuanto al acceso para personas con deshabilidades. Anteriormente, las personas con limitaciones visuales pod&iacute;an leer las p&aacute;ginas electr&oacute;nicas mediante el uso de los sistemas auditivos de lectores de pantalla. Ahora, las p&aacute;ginas electr&oacute;nicas con material gr&aacute;fico son una barrera si no incorporan dise&ntilde;os accesibles. La barrera creada por las p&aacute;ginas electr&oacute;nicas inaccesibles no se limita a personas con deshabilidades visuales o de movilidad sino tambi&eacute;n a personas con deshabilidades del aprendizaje o cognoscitivas. De igual manera, las personas con limitaciones auditivas no pueden tener acceso a material en formato de audio o video a menos que &eacute;stos incluyan subt&iacute;tulos.</p>  <p>El dise&ntilde;o del entrenamiento accesible en l&iacute;nea a trav&eacute;s de la Internet, puede ser muy valioso para otros empleados adem&aacute;s de aquellos con deshabilidades; otros empleados van a encontrarlo m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil de usar<sup>3</sup>. A continuaci&oacute;n se&ntilde;alaremos algunos factores que pueden tomarse en cuenta en cuanto al acceso a la inform&aacute;tica:</p>  <p>* Reconocer que no todos los formatos PDF pueden ser interpretados por los sistemas de lectores de pantalla <sup>4</sup>(para personas con discapacidad visual) y por &eacute;sto se debe ofrecer la alternativa de un formato s&oacute;lo texto, en caso de que se utilice uno de PDF inaccesible;</p>  <p>* El uso de Alt. / identificaciones y etiquetas se recomienda para denominar gr&aacute;ficas o fotos / diagramas;</p>  <p>* No se recomienda el uso de informaci&oacute;n al margen;</p>  <p>* Evite el uso de textos en formato Flash y Java.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <p><sup>3</sup> Use &ldquo;Boby&rdquo; (<a class=\"redlink\" href=\"http://www.cast.ortg/boby\" target=\"new\">http://www.cast.ortg/boby</a>); &ldquo;WAVE&rdquo;<a class=\"redlink\" href=\"http://www.Temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/\" target=\"new\">http://www.Temple.edu/inst_disabilities/piat/wave/</a>) : como usar herramientas de evaluaci&oacute;n para examinar sus p&aacute;ginas en la Internet.</p>  <p><sup>4</sup> Para obtener un ejemplo de c&oacute;mo un lector de pantalla funciona vaya a la p&aacute;gina en la Internet: <a class=\"redlink\" href=\"http://www.afb.org/info_document_view.asp?documentID=1284\" target=\"new\">http://www.afb.org/info_document_view.asp?documentID=1284</a></p>  </div>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;Se deben considerar otras alternativas relacionadas al entrenamiento?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>R: Bajo las normas de la ADA, las entidades cubiertas por &eacute;sta ley no pueden utilizar a terceras partes para discriminar a su favor. Por este motivo los empleadores deben considerar la posibilidad de ofrecer informaci&oacute;n sobre la ADA a aquellas organizaciones con las que tienen contratos, como las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as de seguro, los administradores de terceras partes para beneficios de compensaci&oacute;n al empleado o de salud, los sindicatos laborales, o los programas de asistencia a los empleados.</p>  <p>El T&iacute;tulo I de la ADA proh&iacute;be la discriminaci&oacute;n bajo cualquier t&eacute;rmino, condiciones y privilegios de empleo incluyendo los beneficios de salud, contra una persona calificada con una deshabilidad. La ADA proh&iacute;be espec&iacute;ficamente que una entidad cubierta participe en un arreglo o contrato discriminatorio con organizaciones que ofrecen beneficios marginales a los empleados.</p>  <p>En caso que los empleados est&eacute;n representados por un sindicato, el representante administrativo del sindicato es la persona del sindicato con la que cada miembro puede tener contacto directo; En otras palabras es aquella persona a la que el empleado puede informar acerca de sus problemas o agravios, aquella persona de la cual puede obtener informaci&oacute;n y a la que el empleado generalmente ve todos los d&iacute;as en el lugar de trabajo. La administraci&oacute;n y el sindicato deber&iacute;an entrenar al representante del sindicato para que ella / &eacute;l pueda diseminar apropiadamente la informaci&oacute;n sobre la ADA. Esta informaci&oacute;n debe ser compartida con los miembros del sindicato en aquellos temas como la funci&oacute;n del sindicato en informar a los trabajadores sobre la no/discriminaci&oacute;n contra personas con deshabilidades en el lugar de trabajo y el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>Existen varios temas relacionados con las normas de la ADA sobre el empleo que pueden ser importantes para el funcionamiento del Programas de Asistencia al Empleado (EAP). El enfoque inicial de los especialistas del EAP estaba dirigido a los servicios para personas con problemas de adicci&oacute;n a las drogas y a las bebidas alcoh&oacute;licas. Obviamente estas personas pueden estar cubiertas bajo las normas de empleo de la ADA. Por lo tanto, es de suma importancia ofrecerle a los especialistas de la EAP informaci&oacute;n sobre qui&eacute;n est&eacute; cubierto y sobre cu&aacute;les son los derechos de personas con deshabilidades bajo la ADA.</p>  <p>Adem&aacute;s, los especialistas de la EAP pueden asistir con preguntas sobre acomodaciones en ciertas situaciones. Los miembros de la SHRM indicaron en la encuesta que les gustar&iacute;a recibir m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n sobre las acomodaciones para personas con problemas mentales. Esto puede ser un tema en el que el personal de la EAP puede ser &uacute;til. Adem&aacute;s, personas con otros tipos de deshabilidades tambi&eacute;n pueden buscar apoyo de los especialistas de la EAP para ayudarles durante momentos dif&iacute;ciles, cuando una discapacidad, condici&oacute;n limitante o una enfermedad grave los afecta en el lugar de trabajo o en su vida en general. Los especialistas de la EAP pueden conformar un sistema de consejo y apoyo que pueda ser utilizado por alguna organizaci&oacute;n y por lo tanto lo m&aacute;s apropiado es darle a estos especialistas la informaci&oacute;n sobre el impacto de la deshabilidad y sobre los derechos de las personas con deshabilidades. Los representantes de la EAP est&aacute;n familiarizados frecuentemente con recursos de la comunidad local y pueden referir a los empleados y supervisores a recursos pertinentes que pueden ser de utilidad para el manejo adecuado en caso de una solicitud de acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>P: &iquest;D&oacute;nde puedo conseguir m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n para llevar a cabo entrenamientos sobre la Ley para personas con deshabilidades?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>R: Muchos distribuidores privados y comerciales as&iacute; como organizaciones sin &aacute;nimo de lucro han desarrollado materiales de informaci&oacute;n y entrenamiento sobre la ADA.

La A.D.A. tambi&eacute;n proh&iacute;be discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de personas calificadas que tengan relaci&oacute;n o asociaci&oacute;n con una persona con una deshabilidad conocida. La A.D.A. se aplica a todos los aspectos relacionados con el empleo, incluyendo el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n y selecci&oacute;n. Se debe estar consciente del imp&aacute;cto de la A.D.A. en cada una de las siguientes areas:</p>  <p>* Anuncios</p>  <p>* Solicitudes</p>  <p>* Descripciones</p>  <p>* Entrevistas</p>  <p>* Pruebas</p>  <p>* Ex&aacute;menes M&eacute;dicos</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo Puedo Asegurarme que las Personas con Deshabilidades se Enteren de la Oferta de Empleo y pueden solicitar?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El proceso de contrataci&oacute;n comienza informando a la gente que hay un puesto vacante. Hay varios pasos que los empleadores pueden seguir para tratar de asegurarse que sus procesos de publicidad y solicitudes son accesibles a personas con deshabilidades.</p>  <p>A&uacute;n cuando un empleador no est&aacute; obligado a proveer informaci&oacute;n escrita en varios formatos de antemano, la informaci&oacute;n debe estar disponible en formularios accesibles cuando estos sean solicitados.</p>  <p>La informaci&oacute;n sobre el puesto debe colocarse o hacerse p&uacute;blica en sitios accesibles a personas con deshabilidad de desplazamiento.</p>  <p>De igual manera, los anuncios de trabajo deben presentarse en un formato de letras grandes, tanto en los sitios de trabajo, como en las oficinas de empleo; para facilitarle a las personas con deshabilidad visual de enterarse sobre el puesto vacante.</p>  <p>El anuncio del trabajo vacante debe incluir un n&uacute;mero de telefono T.D.D. (Aparato de Telecomunicaciones para sordos). (A&uacute;n cuando la direcci&oacute;n sea o no proporcionada) Si el anuncio indica que el solicitante debe acudir en persona, los empleadores deben asegurarse que haya acceso para aquellas personas con deshabilidad de despazamiento, tales como: espacios para estacionarse, rampas y elevadores si la entrevista no se realizar&aacute; en el primer piso. En caso de que al solicitante se le proporcione una mesa o escritorio o que tenga que usar una computadora para llenar una solicitud, &aacute;stas &aacute;reas deben estar tambi&eacute;n accesibles para una persona que utilice una silla de ruedas. Aunque la A.D.A no obliga a los empleadores a concentrarse especialmente en personas con deshabilidad, muchos empleadores deciden informar a las agencia Estatales u organizaciones privadas que trabajan con personas con deshabilidades acerca de puestos de empleo disponibles, debido a que ayuda a sus compa&ntilde;&iacute;as a encontrar empleados nuevos calificados.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest; C&oacute;mo sabr&iacute;a si un solicitante necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para el proceso de solicitud y contrataci&oacute;n?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Un empleador podr&iacute;a incluir informaci&oacute;n en el anuncio o en la solicitud pidiendo a los solicitantes con deshabilidades notificarles la necesidad de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para el proceso de solicitud. Personas con ciertas deshabilidades podr&iacute;an necesitar asistencia para llenar la solicitud por escrito o completar una solicitud computarizada que requiera el uso del teclado o de leer informaci&oacute;n en la pantalla. Un empleador podr&iacute;a informar a los solicitantes lo que el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n conlleva (por ejemplo entrevistas, pruebas escritas con tiempo limitado o demostraci&oacute;n de la funci&oacute;n de trabajo) y podr&iacute;a pegruntarles a los solicitantes si pudiera necesitar una acomodaci&oacute;n para este proceso.</p>  <p>Si la deshabilidad no es obvia el empleador puede requerir que el solicitante presente documentaci&oacute;n v&aacute;lida de un profesional en la materia demostrando que la persona tiene una deshabilidad no aparente y necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; Preguntas puedo hacer en la solicitudes de Empleo ?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El prop&oacute;sito de una solicitud de trabajo es para recopilar informaci&oacute;n sobre habilidades, destrezas, capacitaci&oacute;n, t&iacute;tulos de estudio y referencias del solicitante y las preguntas relacionadas a cualquiera de estas &aacute;reas son permitidas bajo las regulaciones de la A.D.A.

Aseg&uacute;rese de que sus descripciones est&eacute;n actualizadas y que en ellas se pueda diferenciar lo que son las funciones esenciales de las marginales. Las funciones marginales son aqu&eacute;llas que no son absol&uacute;tamente necesarias para el desempe&ntilde;o de las funciones b&aacute;sicas, aunque estas puedan ser convenientes para el empleador.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo debo entrevistar a los Aspirantes?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El prop&oacute;sito de la entrevista es conocer al solicitante y aprender m&aacute;s acerca de su educaci&oacute;n, t&iacute;tulos de estudios, habilidades y experiencia laboral para determinar si puede o no desempe&ntilde;ar el trabajo. Est&aacute; prohibido que el empleador le haga preguntas al empleado en relaci&oacute;n a si es un individuo con una deshabilidad, as&iacute; como interrogarlo sobre el origen o severidad de la misma.</p>  <p>Un buen planteamiento es describir el trabajo detalladamente para que el solicitante tenga un mejor entendimiento de lo que se espera, y luego preguntarle al solicitante si &eacute;l o ella puede desempe&ntilde;ar el cargo con una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Un empleador puede tambi&eacute;n pedirle a los solicitantes que describan o demuestren como con o sin una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable desempe&ntilde;aran alguna o todas las funciones de trabajo; siempre y cuando a todos los solicitantes en esta categor&iacute;a de trabajo se les haya pedido lo mismo.</p>  <p>Cualquier acomodaci&oacute;n razonable solicitada por la persona para la entrevista (por ejemplo, un sitio accessible para una persona con una deshabilidad motriz o un int&eacute;rprete de lenguaje de se&ntilde;as para un solicitante sordo) debe ser proporcionada, al menos que constituya un costo o un cambio execivo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Si un solicitante tiene una deshabilidad obvia, &iquest; puedo mencionarla?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Si un empleador cree con certeza que el solicitante no podr&aacute; desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones del trabajo, ya sea por una deshabilidad obvia o una desapercibida que la persona voluntariamente ha manifestado, el empleador podr&iacute;a preguntar a este solicitante en particular que describa o demuestre si &eacute;l o ella puede desempe&ntilde;ar la funci&oacute;n, de igual manera, si el empleador cree con certeza que esa persona necesitar&iacute;a una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para desempe&ntilde;ar el trabajo, ya sea porque el solicitante tenga una deshabilidad obvia o porque el solicitante voluntariamente lo haya expresado. El empleador puede preguntar si &eacute;l o ella necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable y que tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n podr&iacute;a ser necesaria.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Proh&iacute;be la ADA las Pruebas de Empleo?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>No. La A.D.A. s&oacute;lo proh&iacute;be ex&aacute;menes de empleo que descalifican a personas basados en la deshabilidad, cuando no se pueda demostrar que el examen est&aacute; relacionado directamente con el puesto en cuesti&oacute;n y de acuerdo con las necesidaes de la empresa. El objetivo de la A.D.A. es asegurarse que las personas con deshabilidades no sean excluidas de trabajos que puedan desempe&ntilde;ar. Por esto la A.D.A. exige una calificaci&oacute;n justa en el criterio de selecci&oacute;n incluyendo ex&aacute;menes de trabajos y la habilidad del solicitante (o empleado) para desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones del cargo. Las pruebas en las cuales se eval&uacute;an las aptitudes, habilidades, condici&oacute;n f&iacute;sica, habilidad de realizar las funciones del trabajo, ya sean reales o simuladas ning&uacute;n factor m&eacute;dico puede d&aacute;rsele a los solicitantes durante el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n, siendo que estos ex&aacute;menes no son considerados ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos bajo la Ley para personas con deshabilidades (A.D.A.). Aseg&uacute;rese que cualquier prueba que utilice est&eacute; dise&ntilde;ada para probar las funciones esenciales del cargo y que sean formas precisas de predecir el desempe&ntilde;o exitoso del cargo. Adem&aacute;s una prueba de trabajo relacionada a las funciones esenciales de trabajo no puede ser utilizada para excluir a una persona con deshabilidad si ella o &eacute;l puede pasar la prueba con una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo se aplica una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable a las pruebas de trabajo?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los requisitos para una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable est&aacute;n dir&eacute;ctamente relacionados a las pruebas. La A.D.A. protege a personas con deshabilidades de ser excluidos de trabajos que realmente pueden realizar; pero por la deshabilidad no pueden hacer el ex&aacute;men o afectan negativamente el resultado. La A.D.A. exige que se ofrescan pruebas a personas que tengan limitaciones en las habilidades sensoriales, manuales o del habla (incluyendo la habilidad de ver, oir y procesar informaci&oacute;n) de tal manera que no exija el uso de deshabilidades, a menos que la prueba sea dise&ntilde;ada para evaluar la habilidad.</p>  <p>Por ejemplo, a una persona con dislexia se le debe dar la oportunidad de tomar el ex&aacute;men oral, a menos que el ex&aacute;men de lectura sea lo que se est&aacute; calificando. Darle m&aacute;s tiempo a la persona para contestar el ex&aacute;men, a menos que sea la rapid&eacute;z la que se est&eacute; evaluando. Adem&aacute;s, se deber&aacute; proporcionar un sitio accessible para tomar el ex&aacute;men a un solicitante con deshabilidad de desplazamiento; siempre y cuando, &eacute;l o ella lo solicite. Como siempre, el empleador no tiene que proveer una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable si esto constituye un costo o cambio exesivo.</p>  <p>Es una buena idea informar con anticipaci&oacute;n a los solicitantes acerca de la manera en que los ex&aacute;menes que se llevar&aacute;n a cabo para darles oportunidad de solicitar la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que necesiten. En ocasiones es posible que la persona no se de cuenta que necesita la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable hasta que est&aacute; realizando el ex&aacute;men; por ejemplo, una persona con deshabilidad visual que usualmente lee material escrito se da cuenta que no puede leer el ex&aacute;men debido al contraste poco com&uacute;n entre el papel y la tinta del ex&aacute;men, en este caso el empleador podr&iacute;a proveer el ex&aacute;men en un formato con mejor contraste o prorrogar el ex&aacute;men para otra fecha, o hacer cualquier otra acomodaci&oacute;n necesaria que no constituya un costo o cambio execivo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Existen reglas especiales para los ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>S&iacute;, las preguntas relacionadas con deshabilidades o ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos, cuestionarios de salud est&aacute;n prohibidos hasta que se le haya hecho al solicitante una oferta formal de trabajo.</p>  <p>Un ex&aacute;men m&eacute;dico se define como un procedimiento o prueba que busca informaci&oacute;n sobre la deshabilidad f&iacute;sica o mental del solicitante.</p>  <p>El empleo puede depender del resultado de las preguntas relacionadas con deshabilidades o ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos hechos posteriormente a la oferta.

El objetivo de &eacute;ste art&iacute;culo es dar a conocer a los empleadores los requisitos legales y los aspectos psicom&eacute;tricos que deben ser considerados al utilizar pruebas de selecci&oacute;n de personal bajo la ADA.</p>  <p>Existen tres tipos de informaci&oacute;n que deben considerarse al emplear pruebas de selecci&oacute;n de personal bajo la ADA. Primero, los empleadores deben estar familiarizados con los requisitos legales de la ADA y con los argumentos que respaldan esos requisitos. Segundo, los empleadores deben conocer el papel espec&iacute;fico de cada prueba que utilizan para ayudar a seleccionar empleados calificados (en otras palabras, la base de la validez de esas pruebas). Tercero, los empleadores deben estar familiarizados con los tipos de acomodaciones que tienen mayor probabilidad de requerirse para preservar la confiabilidad y validez de las pruebas utilizadas con personas que tienen diversas deshabilidades.</p>  </div>  <h2>Requisitos Legales y de Ordenamiento</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Bajo la ADA, se considera discriminatorio utilizar criterios de selecci&oacute;n que descarten o contribuyan a descartar a personas con deshabilidades a menos que se demuestre que los criterios est&aacute;n laboralmente relacionados al puesto de trabajo en cuesti&oacute;n y consistentes con las necesidades de la actividad en que se desempe&ntilde;a la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a. Esto es para asegurar que las pruebas no se conviertan en barreras para el empleo de personas con deshabilidades a menos que la persona no est&eacute; en capacidad de desempe&ntilde;arse en el cargo a&uacute;n si se le ofrece acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  <p>Los empleadores deben dise&ntilde;ar criterios de selecci&oacute;n para los puestos de trabajo que aseguren una estrecha compatibilidad entre dichos criterios y la habilidad de una persona para realizar el trabajo. Un criterio que tienda a descartar a una persona con una deshabilidad debe sustentarse en que est&aacute; relacionado espec&iacute;ficamente con el tipo de trabajo requerido para el cargo y adem&aacute;s es consistente con las necesidades de la empresa. Para que se pueda determinar esta consistencia, un criterio debe estar relacionado a una funci&oacute;n esencial del trabajo. La obligaci&oacute;n de hacer acomodaciones razonables significa que un empleador debe hacer modificaciones o ajustes al proceso de selecci&oacute;n de personal de tal manera que una persona calificada y que tiene una deshabilidad pueda tenerse en cuenta para el cargo que desea.</p>  <p>Las pruebas no deben administrarse en formatos que requieran el uso de la habilidad afectada, a menos que sea una facultad que est&aacute; ligada a las funciones del cargo y que la prueba busca medir espec&iacute;ficamente. Por ejemplo, es ilegal administrar una prueba escrita a una persona que no puede leer por problemas de dislexia, a menos que la facultad de leer sea la habilidad ligada espec&iacute;ficamente al cargo y que la prueba justamente est&aacute; dise&ntilde;ada para medirla. Si, por el contrario, la prueba est&aacute; dise&ntilde;ada para medir un factor como la comprensi&oacute;n o el razonamiento verbales, la prueba deber&aacute; administrarse en forma oral. De la misma manera, los controles de tiempo deber&aacute;n ser flexibles para los aspirantes cuyas deshabilidades causan que requieran m&aacute;s tiempo para tomar la prueba a menos que &eacute;sta haya sido espec&iacute;ficamente dise&ntilde;ada para evaluar velocidad. Sin embargo, los resultados de una prueba de velocidad no pueden ser usados para exclu&iacute;r a una persona con una deshabilidad a menos que la habilidad sea necesaria para desempe&ntilde;ar una funci&oacute;n esencial relacionada con el cargo, y donde el aspirante no se puede desempe&ntilde;ar con o sin una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Si la velocidad es indispensable para ejecutar una funci&oacute;n esencial del trabajo y no hay una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable disponible para permitirle al aspirante demostrar la habilidad o ejecutar el trabajo, entonces el empleador no est&aacute; obligado a contratar al candidato.</p>  <p>Un empleador est&aacute; obligado a hacer acomodaciones razonables s&oacute;lo para las limitaciones f&iacute;sicas o mentales que se derivan de la deshabilidad que tiene un individuo calificado y que son conocidas por el empleador. Mientras que un empleador puede indagar si un empleado est&aacute; teniendo dificultades en el desempe&ntilde;o de sus funciones, generalmente es responsabilidad del empleado informar a su empleador que se necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n para una deshabilidad.</p>  <p>En la misma l&iacute;nea, generalmente se requiere que un empleador ofrezca acomodaciones durante las pruebas s&oacute;lamente si sabe por anticipado que un aspirante tiene una deshabilidad que necesita de dicha acomodaci&oacute;n. Usualmente es responsabilidad del individuo con una deshabilidad solicitar cualquier acomodaci&oacute;n que necesita para presentar una prueba. El empleador puede ser de gran ayuda si informa por anticipado a los aspirantes acerca de todas las pruebas que ser&aacute;n administradas como parte del proceso de selecci&oacute;n, de tal manera que ellos puedan solicitar una acomodaci&oacute;n si se necesita. Los empleadores pueden tambi&eacute;n preguntar a los solicitantes si ellos necesitar&aacute;n una acomodaci&oacute;n para el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Debe mencionarse tambi&eacute;n que la ADA y las estipulaciones del T&iacute;tulo I proh&iacute;ben que se hagan averiguaciones previas a una contrataci&oacute;n acerca de la deshabilidad de una persona o de su naturaleza, a excepci&oacute;n de un caso muy particular. La ADA permite a los empleadores preguntar a las personas con una deshabilidad no visible y que est&aacute;n solicitando acomodaciones durante la fase de selecci&oacute;n, que presenten documentaci&oacute;n razonable que permita verificar la deshabilidad y la necesidad de acomodaci&oacute;n. Sin embargo, el empleador no pueder hacer averiguaciones adicionales en relaci&oacute;n con la naturaleza y severidad de la deshabilidad. Por esta raz&oacute;n, los empleadores pueden utilizar un ex&aacute;men psicol&oacute;gico antes de ofrecer un puesto en el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n, pero s&oacute;lo si estos ex&aacute;menes no son de tipo m&eacute;dico; es decir, si estos ex&aacute;menes no prueban la existencia de un desorden mental.</p>  </div>  <h2>Modelos de Validez de Pruebas</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El uso de pruebas para tomar decisiones en materia de selecci&oacute;n de personal est&aacute; sustentado por evidencia acerca de la validez de la prueba bajo uno o varios de los siguientes modelos:</p>  <p>* Validez de contenido: la prueba es una muestra representativa del desempe&ntilde;o en un &aacute;rea determinada de conocimiento, destreza, habilidad u otra caracter&iacute;stica relacionada directamente con el trabajo.</p>  <p>* Validez de concepto: se ha demostrado que la prueba es una medida de una caracter&iacute;stica relevante del trabajo (por ejemplo, razonamiento verbal).</p>  <p>* Validez condicionada a un criterio: se ha mostrado que la prueba est&aacute; estad&iacute;sticamente relacionada a alg&uacute;n criterio de desempe&ntilde;o satisfactorio en el trabajo.</p>  <p>Las acomodaciones se deben hacer de tal manera que se mantenga la validez de las pruebas para seleccionar personal calificado.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tipo de Acomodaciones en las Pruebas</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las acomodaciones en las pruebas se explicar&aacute;n bajo tres grandes categor&iacute;as: formato de la prueba, l&iacute;mites en el tiempo de administraci&oacute;n y contenido.</p>  <p><b><i>Formato de la Prueba</i></b>. Un cambio en el formato de la prueba se refiere al uso de un medio o m&eacute;todo diferente para presentar la misma informaci&oacute;n. La informaci&oacute;n de una prueba suele presentarse en forma impresa y en Ingl&eacute;s. Por lo tanto ser&iacute;an formas alternativas de presentaci&oacute;n el lenguaje Braille, tipos grandes de letras, un lector o una cinta magnetof&oacute;nica. En la mayor&iacute;a de los casos estos formatos pueden intercambiarse sin cambiar el contenido de las preguntas o la habilidad que est&aacute; siendo evaluada. Sin embargo, al usar diferentes formatos surgen diferentes problemas:</p>  <p>1. La presentaci&oacute;n oral o en otros formatos de pasajes extensos de lectura puede presentar problemas a los aspirantes con dificultades visuales. Para las presentaciones orales, el examinado intentar&aacute; mantener todo el pasaje en la memoria. En lenguaje Braille o en tipos grandes de letras, el recorrido por el pasaje es m&aacute;s lento que con el tipo de letra corriente.</p>  <p>2. El material ilustrado es problem&aacute;tico para las personas con impedimentos visuales. Aplicar alto relieve a este tipo de material no debe verse como un simple cambio de formato porque el sentido t&aacute;ctil es bastante diferente del sentido visual (por consiguiente la necesidad del Braille).</p>  <p>3. Cuando se emplean lectores, deben ser personas que lean y articulen correctamente y con claridad, y deben practicar de antemano la lectura de la prueba. As&iacute; mismo se les debe advertir que deben tener precauci&oacute;n en no ir a dar, inadvertidamente, claves a los examinados acerca de la manera de contestar la prueba.</p>  <p>Debe observarse que cambiar una prueba de una versi&oacute;n impresa a una versi&oacute;n en lenguaje de signos equivale a una traducci&oacute;n a otro lenguaje y no es tan s&oacute;lo un cambio de formato. &Eacute;sta tarea debe asumirse con todo el cuidado posible como si se procediera a traducir un texto de Ingl&eacute;s a, por ejemplo, Japon&eacute;s.</p>  <p><b><i>L&iacute;mites de tiempo</i></b>. En muchos casos en donde se hace acomodaciones de pruebas es necesario cambiar los l&iacute;mites de tiempo de las mismas. A menudo este tipo de cambio se traduce en problemas de interpretaci&oacute;n de resultados de las pruebas. Este problema surge debido al uso de &ldquo;pruebas de capacidad de alta velocidad&rdquo;. Para comprender este problema es necesario aprender un poco de terminolog&iacute;a psicom&eacute;trica.</p>  <p>Una prueba directa de capacidad es aquella en la cual todos tienen la oportunidad de intentar contestar cada pregunta, y las puntuaciones se basan en cu&aacute;ntas preguntas las personas pueden contestar en lugar de contabilizar qu&eacute; tan r&aacute;pido trabajaron. La prueba de velocidad pura, por el contrario, tiene preguntas de dificultad moderada asignadas en un periodo de tiempo limitado.</p>  <p>Las puntuaciones se basan s&oacute;lo en la velocidad con que son contestadas. Muchas pruebas que intentan ser de capacidad son de alguna manera pruebas de velocidad porque un considerable n&uacute;mero de personas son incapaces de contestar cada pregunta. En una prueba de velocidad que mide capacidad, una persona con tiempo ilimitado tiene ventaja sobre personas que la tomaron bajo un l&iacute;mite de tiempo establecido. Sin embargo, dado que varias personas con deshabilidades, por ejemplo, usuarios de Braille, necesitan de tiempo extra para presentar pruebas, se genera un problema complicado al determinar exactamente cu&aacute;nto tiempo extra se puede asignar de tal manera que el aspirante al empleo, quien tiene una deshabilidad, no se encuentre ni en ventaja ni en desventaja.</p>  <p>La soluci&oacute;n ideal a este problema ser&iacute;a la eliminaci&oacute;n de las pruebas de velocidad. Si una prueba de capacidad tiene un l&iacute;mite de tiempo holgado, digamos, con un porcentaje de finalizaci&oacute;n de aproximadamente 95 por ciento de todas las personas que toman la prueba, entonces los aspirantes con deshabilidades pueden recibir tiempo ilimitado sin que se incurra en una concesi&oacute;n ventajosa. En este caso, la pregunta compleja de cuanto tiempo adicional hay que asignar desaparece en el acto.</p>  <p>En el caso de las pruebas de velocidad existentes en donde el l&iacute;mite de tiempo normal no puede cambiarse, asignar tiempo ilimitado puede ser inconveniente. Un m&eacute;todo para saber cu&aacute;les ser&iacute;an los l&iacute;mites de tiempo apropiados es realizar pruebas emp&iacute;ricas. La Oficina de Administraci&oacute;n de Personal realiz&oacute; un estudio para establecer los l&iacute;mites de tiempo para aspirantes con impedimentos visuales y auditivos de una de las pruebas que utiliza m&aacute;a gran escala. Se encontr&oacute; que se requer&iacute;a al menos el doble del tiempo para los usuarios de todos los medios con dificultades visuales para contestar preguntas que consist&iacute;an en pasajes breves de lectura seguidos de cinco alternativas de respuesta. Las preguntas de Matem&aacute;tica que implicaban c&aacute;lculos, en cambio, necesitaron m&aacute;s tiempo que las de lectura. Estos estudios emp&iacute;ricos son posibles s&oacute;lo en programas a gran escala en donde hay numerosos examinados.</p>  <p>Las pruebas de velocidad pura se usan en el contexto de la selecci&oacute;n de personal para evaluar destrezas tales como velocidad perceptual y habilidades de oficina. Estas pruebas son claramente inapropiadas para ser usadas con personas con impedimentos visuales porque todos los medios para transmitir informaci&oacute;n son lentos, y para algunos aspirantes con impedimentos f&iacute;sicos, el mecanismo f&iacute;sico para responder lo es igualmente &ldquo;por ejemplo, marcar las hojas de respuesta&rdquo;.</p>  El l&iacute;mite de tiempo no se puede ajustar en estas pruebas porque la velocidad es justamente el factor que se est&aacute; midiendo. Por lo tanto, el examinador debe decidir si la prueba de velocidad debe utilizarse dentro del l&iacute;mite de tiempo establecido &ldquo;lo cual es permisible, como se explic&oacute; en la secci&oacute;n anterior sobre requisitos y ordenamientos legales: si el factor de velocidad es indespensable para ejecutar una funci&oacute;n esencial del cargo y el aspirante no puede cumplir con el requisito incluso bajo una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable&iacute; o si la prueba debe eliminarse de la bater&iacute;a y reemplazarse con otro tipo de evaluaci&oacute;n. Este ser&iacute;a el caso del &uacute;ltimo tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n para presentar una prueba: cambiar su contenido.  <p><b><i>Contenido de la prueba</i></b>. En el contexto de la aplicaci&oacute;n de pruebas competitivas a personas con deshabilidades, los cambios en el contenido de las pruebas son poco frecuentes. Sin embargo, es claro que este tipo de cambios es una forma de acomodaci&oacute;n que puede ser requerida para cumplir con la A.D.A. Todo cambio en el contenido de una prueba deber&aacute; ser consistente con la estrategia de validaci&oacute;n en la cual est&aacute; basada. Por ejemplo, cambiar una pregunta por otra se puede hacer f&aacute;cilmente bajo un modelo de validez de concepto, pero puede ser problem&aacute;tico bajo un modelo de validez de contenido.</p>  <p>Los cambios en el contenido de una prueba pueden dividirse por conveniencia en tres tipos: cambio de las preguntas individuales, cambio en el tipo de pregunta, o cambio o eliminaci&oacute;n en la medici&oacute;n de un conocimiento, una habilidad o una destreza. El primer tipo de cambio, como se mencion&oacute; anteriormente, se realiza f&aacute;cilmente en una prueba de validez de concepto. El segundo tipo de cambio, es decir, la utilizaci&oacute;n de un tipo diferente de pregunta para evaluar la misma habilidad, es factible si existe otro tipo de pregunta del mismo estilo y si se puede determinar que haya comparabilidad en el sistema de puntuaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>La gu&iacute;a de interpretaci&oacute;n del T&iacute;tulo I de las disposiciones de la Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidades en el Empleo (EEOC) describe algunas sustituciones simples de m&eacute;todos para medir los mismos Conocimientos, Destrezas y Habilidades (KSA en ingl&eacute;s), como se puede ver en el siguiente aparte:</p>  <p><i>&ldquo;Donde no sea posible evaluar en un formato alternativo, al empleador puede exig&iacute;rsele, como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, que eval&uacute;e la destreza objetivo de otra manera (por ejemplo, a trav&eacute;s de una entrevista, a de una licencia educativa, o requisitos de experiencia en el trabajo).&rdquo;</i></p>  <p>Esta cita no refleja ning&uacute;n inter&eacute;s en resaltar la comparabilidad en las puntuaciones. De hecho, es dif&iacute;cil apreciar c&oacute;mo se podr&iacute;a usar este enfoque si los aspirantes deben ser clasificados sobre la base de puntuaciones cuantitativas.</p>  <p>Si no hay una manera de evaluar a una persona con una deshabilidad para ciertos Conocimientos, Destrezas o Habilidades (KSA), y si hay motivo para creer que estas categor&iacute;as no se requerir&aacute;n del aspirante para desempe&ntilde;ar el trabajo, el requisito de medidas de este m&eacute;todo (KSA) debe ser eliminado.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodaciones para Deshabilidades Espec&iacute;ficas</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La siguiente es una lista breve de los tipos de acomodaciones en las pruebas que son apropiadas para los examinados con diferentes deshabilidades. Para informaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s detallada acerca de cada grupo, consulte la bibliograf&iacute;a al final del art&iacute;culo titulado &ldquo;Pruebas de Pre-empleo y la ADA&rdquo; publicado por Publicaciones del LRP (consulte la car&aacute;tula de este folleto para informaci&oacute;n acerca de pedidos).</p>  <p><i>Para examinados con impedimentos visuales</i>, las pruebas deben presentarse en formatos apropiados, tales como en Braille, tipos de letra grande, y cintas de audio. Los l&iacute;mites de tiempo deben extenderse para todos estos medios, y las pruebas de velocidad son inconvenientes. Dentro del contexto de cambiar los materiales de prueba en diferentes formatos, ciertos tipos de materiales pueden ser problem&aacute;ticos, como se mencion&oacute; anteriormente. Adicionalmente, el examinado probablemente requerir&aacute; acomodaci&oacute;n o asistencia al momento de marcar sus respuestas.</p>  <i>Para examinados con impedimentos f&iacute;sicos que afectan el uso de las manos</i>, la acomodaci&oacute;n principal es el ajuste del l&iacute;mite de tiempo de la prueba y la eliminaci&oacute;n de pruebas de velocidad. Asi mismo, localidades accesibles, la ayuda de un asistente para cambiar las p&aacute;ginas y marcar las respuestas, as&iacute; como periodos de descanso adicionales. Entre las personas con dificultades auditivas que presentan pruebas, s&oacute;lo las personas con impedimento auditivo total necesitan acomodaciones especiales para las pruebas. Para la mayor&iacute;a de <i>personas con sordera preling&uuml;&iacute;stica</i>, es decir aquellas personas que perdieron su audici&oacute;n antes de adquirir el habla, las pruebas verbales no son medidas apropiadas de que se tenga alguna habilidad. Para la mayor&iacute;a de estas personas, Ingl&eacute;s es la segunda lengua y el lenguaje original es el de se&ntilde;as. (Por supuesto que hay excepciones a esta regla; algunas personas tienen muy buenas destrezas con el Ingl&eacute;s). Por consiguiente, como regla general, las pruebas verbales no se pueden usar efectivamente con la mayor parte de examinados sordos: t&oacute;do puede evaluarse menos la habilidad verbal. Las pruebas que son completamente no verbales, por el contrario, no presentan ning&uacute;n problema. Las instrucciones de la prueba han de administrarse cuidadosamente, mediante el uso de lenguaje de se&ntilde;as o demostraciones, y los l&iacute;mites de tiempo deben explicarse cl&aacute;ramente. Tiempo extra debe asignarse en pruebas de esfuerzo que incluyen material no verbal.  <p><i>Individuos con deshabilidades de lenguaje espec&iacute;ficas</i> constituyen ahora el grupo m&aacute;s numeroso que requiere de acomodaciones en las pruebas de selecci&oacute;n. Las tareas espec&iacute;ficas que son afectadas por las deshabilidades de aprendizaje var&iacute;an ampliamente por lo cual es dif&iacute;cil hacer generalizaciones en torno a las acomodaciones. &Eacute;stas deben realizarse seg&uacute;n cada caso individual y seg&uacute;n cada deshabilidad espec&iacute;fica. La acomodaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s ampliamente usada es la extensi&oacute;n en el l&iacute;mite de tiempo en las pruebas de esfuerzo y la reconsideraci&oacute;n de pruebas de velocidad en aquellas &aacute;reas de m&aacute;s debilidad. Por ejemplo, un examinado con una deshabilidad de aprendizaje que le afecta su capacidad de c&aacute;lculo num&iacute;rico puede ser descartado por una prueba de velocidad en este campo. Bajo la ADA, es inapropiado utilizar esa prueba a menos que eval&uacute;e una funci&oacute;n esencial del trabajo que el aspirante no puede desempe&ntilde;ar con o sin acomodaci&oacute;n razonable.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Marianne Nester','Marianne Nester',112,'de la Oficina de Servicio de Emigraci&oacute;n y Naturalizaci&oacute;n de los EE.UU., Washington, D.C.

Entre las acomodaciones razonables m&aacute;s viables incluyen la reestructuraci&oacute;n del trabajo a medio tiempo o modificaci&oacute;n de los horarios, asistencia tecnol&oacute;gica, suministro de aparatos axiliares o interpretes calificados, cambio de pruebas y pol&iacute;ticas, reasignaci&oacute;n a un puesto vacante. La obligaci&oacute;n de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable se extiende tambi&eacute;n a los beneficios y privilegios de empleo, tales como: capacitaci&oacute;n patrocinada por el empleador, servicios y eventos sociales. Generalmente el individuo con una deshabilidad debe informar al empleador de la necesidad de una acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Aunque la ADA no le exige al empleador que haga una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable que implique una &ldquo;inconveniencia excesiva&rdquo; (definida como un acomodaci&oacute;n significat&iacute;vamente dif&iacute;cil de instalar o sumamente costosa), la experiencia de los empleadores alrededor de la naci&oacute;n muestra que muchas de las acomodaciones no implican costo alguno, y son muy pocas las acomodaciones que &ldquo;implican gastos significativos&rdquo; que tiendan a desestabilizar el presupuesto financiero de los empleadores. Estudios efectuados en 1986 y 1992 muestran que en m&aacute;s de la mitad de las acomodaciones suministradas a los empleados con deshabilidades no hubo necesidad de incurrir en gastos, y un 15% costaron menos de $500. Los incentivos de impuestos est&aacute;n disponibles para los negocios que eliminan las barreras arquitect&oacute;nicas que impiden el libre acceso a las personas con deshabilidades, a los que crean fuentes de trabajo para los individuos con deshabilidades, o a los que prov&eacute;en tecnolog&iacute;a asistiva o int&eacute;rpretes a estos trabajadores.</p>  <p>Los empleadores est&aacute;n obligados a proveer acomodaciones razonables para los individuos calificados que presentan alguna deshabilidad, y quienes son definidos por la ADA como aquellas personas que satisfacen los requerimientos relativos a un trabajo en curso, o al cual se aspira, y quien puede realizar las &ldquo;funciones esenciales&rdquo; del cargo, con o sin acomodaciones razonables. Los empleadores definen las funciones esenciales del empleo; las descripciones de los cargos, preparadas antes que el individuo es entrevistado o seleccionado para un puesto son consideradas evidencia de las funciones esenciales de un puesto. Si un individuo no puede realizar lo que corresponde a las funciones esenciales del empleo, con o sin acomodaciones, el individuo no es considerado un &ldquo;trabajador calificado con una deshabilidad&rdquo; bajo la Ley.</p>  <p>El empleador debe acordar con el empleado en relaci&oacute;n al tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n que le facilitar&iacute;a, al empleado realizar las funciones esenciales del puesto de trabajo. Los requerimientos de la posici&oacute;n de trabajo en particular y las limitaciones f&iacute;sicas o mentales del empleado deben ser evaluadas para determinar una o m&aacute;s posibles acomodaciones que prodr&iacute;an ser m&aacute;s efectivas.</p>  <p>Si una acomodaci&oacute;n constituye una &ldquo;inconveniencia excesiva&rdquo;, no es necesario que &eacute;sta sea implementada. Una inconveniencia excesiva se puede evaluar determinando varios factores que incluyen la naturaleza y el costo espec&iacute;fico de la acomodaci&oacute;n, los recursos financieros totales (de la empresa) tanto de las instalaciones f&iacute;sicas y el tama&ntilde;o (de la entidad comercial) empresa, y el impacto que tendr&iacute;a la acomodaci&oacute;n en las operaciones de la planta. Las acomodaciones de tipo personal que son usadas tanto dentro como fuera del trabajo (tales como un perro gu&iacute;a para un empleado con impedimentos visuales o una silla de ruedas) no son responsabilidad del empleador.</p>  <p>El empleador no necesita crear un puesto nuevo para la persona con una deshabilidad, ni est&aacute; en la obligaci&oacute;n de transferir responsabilidades de las funciones esenciales a otro trabajador. En cambio s&iacute; puede solicit&aacute;rsele que reestructure un trabajo mediante la reasignaci&oacute;n de funciones marginales, no esenciales. Por ejemplo, el Servicio Postal se neg&oacute; a promover a una secretaria con impedimento auditivo porque ella no pod&iacute;a contestar el tel&eacute;fono.</p>  <p>La Corte orden&oacute; a las oficinas del Servicio Postal que la promovieran, indicando que hab&iacute;a otras secretarias para contestar el tel&eacute;fono adem&aacute;s que esta tarea es considerada de bajo perfil y no una funci&oacute;n esencial para desempe&ntilde;ar el cargo de secretaria.</p>  <p>Algunos Juzgados y la Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo (E.E.O.C.) han determinado que el sitio donde se llevan a cabo las funciones de trabajo es otra pol&iacute;tica que podr&iacute;a ser modificada como un acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para ciertos empleos, siempre y cuando la acomodaci&oacute;n sea efectiva y no constituya un costo o cambio excesivo. La E.E.O.C. ha determinado que ciertos trabajos como meseros o cajeros s&oacute;lo pueden ser realizados en el lugar de trabajo, mientras que otros trabajos como vendedor por tel&eacute;fono o corrector de material escrito pueden ser realizados en la casa. La E.E.O.C. ha determinado que ciertas consideraciones en cuanto a que si un trabajo puede realizarse en casa incluyendo supervisi&oacute;n y la necesidad de cierto equipo que no puede ser adaptado a la casa son pertinentes. Los Juzgados que han rechazado que trabajar en casa sea un acomodaci&oacute;n razonable se basan en el hecho de que el contacto personal, la interacci&oacute;n y coordinaci&oacute;n son necesarios para un puesto espec&iacute;fico.</p>  <p>Algunos empleadores que temen que al acomodar a un empleado con una deshabilidad se afectar&aacute; la moral de los dem&aacute;s empleados no encontrar&aacute;n en este argumento ayuda en su defensa contra cargos bajo la ADA. Ni tampoco la idea de que los empleados o los clientes no quisieran interactuar con una persona con una deshabilidad es raz&oacute;n suficiente para negarle a esa persona la oportunidad de obtener empleo.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>La Acomodaci&oacute;n de un Trabajador con una Deshabilidad</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n se inicia antes que el trabajador que tiene una deshabilidad sea contratado (o identificado, si es actualmente un empleado que ha sufrido una deshabilidad despu&eacute;s de haber sido contratado). Las descripciones de cargo (deben de ser) preparadas antes de anunciarse la posici&oacute;n disponible o de entrevistar a los aspirantes son evidencia de si funciones particulares del puesto de trabajo se deben entender como funciones esenciales; otro tipo de evidencia que tambi&eacute;n es relevante es el tipo de actividades que en la pr&aacute;ctica est&aacute;n desempe&ntilde;ando las personas que tuvieron o tienen actualmente el cargo. La descripciones de trabajo deben ser revisadas para asegurarse que en ellas se incluya y se haga clara menci&oacute;n de las funciones esenciales de cada trabajo, particularmente en relaci&oacute;n a los requisitos f&iacute;sicos. Afirmaciones tales como &ldquo;todas las funciones del cargo deben ser ejecutadas por parte de todos a los que incumbe&rdquo; o &ldquo;no hay tarea f&aacute;cil en este departamento&rdquo; no son determinantes de si una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable debe ofrecerse.</p>  <p>El personal encargado de reclutar o entrevistar a los aplicantes debe ser entrenado en relaci&oacute;n a qu&eacute; tipo de interrogantes son permitidos bajo la ADA. Bajo la ADA un empleador no debe incurrir en preguntarle al aspirante con una deshabilidad acerca de la existencia, el origen o severidad de la deshabilidad; tampoco le es permitido exigirle a los aspirantes pruebas de ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos sin antes haberle hecho una oferta condicional de trabajo. Estas prohibiciones aseguran que la deshabilidad no visible de un aspirante no sea inclu&iacute;da de antemano en la valoraci&oacute;n de los aspectos no m&eacute;dicos del candidato.</p>  <p>El empleador puede preguntar al solicitante acerca de sus habilidades para desempe&ntilde;ar funciones espec&iacute;ficas relacionadas con el puesto antes de hacer la oferta de trabajo. Un empleador generalmente, no puede preguntarle al solicitante si &eacute;l o ella necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para desempe&ntilde;ar el trabajo durante el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n antes de que una oferta condicional haya sido hecha, excepto cuando el empleador sabe que el solicitante tiene una deshabilidad ya sea que esta es obvia o porque el solicitante voluntariamente ha proporcionado la informaci&oacute;n y podr&iacute;a creerse que el solicitante necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable para realizar las funciones espec&iacute;ficas del trabajo.</p>  <p>Si el solicitante responde afirmativamente, el empleador puede preguntar qu&eacute; tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n es necesaria, el empleador puede hacer preguntas no relacionadas con la deshabilidad y requerir ex&aacute;menes que no sean necesariamente m&eacute;dicos.</p>  <p>Despu&eacute;s de haber hecho una oferta condicional, un empleador puede exigirle al aplicante prueba de ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos o hacer preguntas relativas a una deshabilidad si todos los dem&aacute;s candidatos al mismo puesto son sometidos a las mismas preguntas y pruebas. El empleador tambi&eacute;n puede preguntar si el solicitante necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable en relaci&oacute;n a todo lo concerniente al trabajo incluyendo participaci&oacute;n en prestaciones y privilegios de empleo, siempre y cuando a todos los empleados en la misma categor&iacute;a de trabajo se les haya hecho esta pregunta. Alternativamente, un empleador puede preguntarle a un solicitante espec&iacute;fico si ella o &eacute;l necesita una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable si el empleador sabe que el solicitante tiene una deshabilidad ya sea porque &eacute;sta es obvia o porque el solicitante voluntariamente proporcion&oacute; la informaci&oacute;n y podr&iacute;a creerse con certeza que el solicitante necesitar&aacute; una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Si el o la solicitante responde afirmativamente el empleador puede preguntar qu&eacute; tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n necesita.</p>  <p>Si un ex&aacute;men o cuestionamiento rechaza a un individuo por deshabilidad, el criterio de exclusi&oacute;n debe ser relacionado al trabajo a realizarse y consistente en las necesidades de la empresa. El empleador debe demostrar que el criterio no es satisfactorio y que las funciones esenciales no pueden ser realizadas con una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, tambi&eacute;n se les permite a los empleadores requerir ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos y hacer preguntas relacionadas a las deshabilidades y a los empleados, siempre y cuando tales ex&aacute;menes o preguntas sean relacionadas al trabajo y consientes con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p>El empleador debe mantener de manera confidencial cualquier informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica obtenida. &Eacute;sto significa que el empleador debe conservar y mantener la informaci&oacute;n en formatos y archivos m&eacute;dicos separados. El empleador puede compartir esta informaci&oacute;n s&oacute;lo con entidades o personal determinado en la ADA.</p>  <p>Los empleadores pueden usar cualquier clase de pruebas para evaluar los requisitos del cargo. Sin embargo, las normas de calificaci&oacute;n, las pruebas u otros criterios de selecci&oacute;n que descalifican a un individuo con una deshabilidad, o a una clase de personas con deshabilidades es violatoria de la ADA a menos que estos criterios muestren estar relacionados con el trabajo y ser consistentes con las necesidades del negocio. A&uacute;n si &eacute;sta demostraci&oacute;n se puede efectuar, un empleador debe considerar si el criterio se cumple o el trabajo se puede realizar proporcionando una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Adicionalmente, las pruebas deben ser administradas a un aspirante o empleado con una deshabilidad de tal forma que se garantice que los resultados de la misma reflejan con precisi&oacute;n las destrezas, aptitudes o cualquier otro factor que se est&eacute; evaluando, en lugar de indicar las deficiencias sensoriales, manuales o de habla del aspirante, a menos que precisamente sean estas las destrezas que se est&aacute;n midiendo.</p>  </div>  <h2>La Seguridad y las Acomodaciones Razonables</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Algunos empleadores sienten la preocupaci&oacute;n que un trabajador con una deshabilidad pueda constituir un riesgo de seguridad, tanto para s&iacute; mismo como para los dem&aacute;s empleados o clientes. La ley toma en cuenta estas preocupaciones, pero s&oacute;lo si estas inquietudes est&aacute;n fundadas bajo evidencia clara y bien documentada de que realmente el individuo es una &ldquo;amenaza directa&rdquo; tanto para s&iacute; mismo como para los dem&aacute;s, debido a la clase de trabajo y a las caracter&iacute;sticas espec&iacute;ficas de la deshabilidad de ese individuo en particular.</p>  <p>Para determinar si un individuo con una deshabilidad constituye una amenaza directa, incluyendo un individuo con una enfermedad contagiosa, los factores que se deben considerar incluyen:</p>  <p>(1) la duraci&oacute;n del riesgo;</p>  <p>(2) la naturaleza y severidad del da&ntilde;o potencial;</p>  <p>(3) la probabilidad de que el peligro potencial pudiese ocurrir; y</p>  <p>(4) la inminencia del peligro potencial.</p>  <p>A&uacute;n si se encuentra que la persona constituye un riesgo inminente a lastimarse, el prop&oacute;sito de la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable es analizar y determinar si el individuo puede ser acomodado de una manera que se puedan eliminar los riesgos o reducirlos a un nivel m&aacute;s aceptable.</p>  <p>En general el criterio de exclusi&oacute;n de condiciones particulares son dif&iacute;ciles de justificar, sobre todo si el empleador no realiza una evaluaci&oacute;n individualizada de la persona que ha sido excluida. Han habido fallos de los juzgados que han rechazado el criterio de exclusi&oacute;n general de personas con diabetes en el &aacute;mbito del orden p&uacute;blico y choferes de camiones. Sin embargo, en otro caso, un juzgado encontr&oacute; que un reclutador de policias diab&eacute;ticos constitu&iacute;a una amenaza directa porque tuvo dos incidentes de desorientaci&oacute;n y p&eacute;rdida de control mientras estaba en servicio. Otro Juzgado encontr&oacute; que la diabetes, enfermedades graves del coraz&oacute;n y la hipertensi&oacute;n en un chofer de autobuses lo convierte en una amenaza directa.</p>  <p>En contraste se encontr&oacute; que una conductora de un minibus (van) escolar con deshabilidad auditiva no constitu&iacute;a una amenaza directa. El Juzgado decret&oacute;, despu&eacute;s de hacer una evaluaci&oacute;n individualizada, que no hab&iacute;a prueba de que la conductora tuviera alg&uacute;n problema para conducir el minibus escolar. Sin pruebas de haber tenido un accidente total o parcial, y sin pruebas de que haya estado distra&iacute;da en su trabajo debido a su deshabilidad. En otro caso concerniente a un vendedor de zapatos epil&eacute;ptico, el Juzgado decret&oacute; que a&uacute;n si el vendedor constituyera un peligro por el riesgo de sufrir un ataque epil&eacute;ptico, hab&iacute;a una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable disponible como cambiar de sitio mercancia que estaba en lugares altos para que el vendedor no tuviera que subirse a una escalera. En general la clave aqu&iacute; es obtener informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica individualizada acerca de las limitaciones que la deshabilidad del trabajador conlleva y el da&ntilde;o probable que los problemas psicol&oacute;gicos y f&iacute;sicos de este individuo afecten la posici&oacute;n en cuesti&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodaciones Razonables y la Mala Conducta del Trabajador</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La ADA protege a los individuos tanto con deshabilidades f&iacute;sicas como mentales y la norma de las acomodaciones razonables se aplica de la misma manera para ambos grupos de deshabilidades. Sin embargo los empleadores pueden tener a los empleados con deshabilidades bajo el mismo r&eacute;gimen disciplinario y de desempe&ntilde;o que mantienen para los dem&aacute;s trabajadores; si el trabajador incurre en mal comportamiento que amerita ser amonestado bajo las pol&iacute;ticas y reglamentos del empleador, a&uacute;n si el comportamiento se relaciona con la deshabilidad del empleado, el empleador puede amonestar al trabajador.</p>  <p>Si un empleado solicita una acomodaci&oacute;n antes de incurrir en un mal comportamiento, por ejemplo, permiso para asistir a sesiones de terapia, la acomodaci&oacute;n se le debe proporcionar a menos que implique una inconveniencia excesiva. De otra parte, si el empleado incurre en mal comportamiento antes de solicitar la acomodaci&oacute;n, el empleador puede imponer la sanci&oacute;n pertinente. Una sanci&oacute;n puede inclu&iacute;r despido, dependiendo del tipo de pol&iacute;tica disciplinaria que tenga el empleador y la naturaleza del mal comportamiento. Si el empleador tiene una pol&iacute;tica de disciplina progresiva, el empleador puede sancionar al trabajador hasta la antesala del despido y luego proporcionar una acomodaci&oacute;n que le facilite al empleado cumplir con las normas de conducta.</p>  <p>Mal comportamiento por fuera del trabajo tambi&eacute;n puede dar pie a amonestaciones o cancelaci&oacute;n del contrato, a&uacute;n si el trabajador asegura que su deshabilidad fue la que propici&oacute; el incidente. En muchos casos que han llegado a los tribunales, se ha encontrado que la causa de la mala conducta ha sido relacionada con el abuso de drogas o alcohol, y para el empleador fue posible comprobar que solicit&aacute;rsele que retenga al trabajador es una incoveniencia excesiva porque el mismo trabajo requiere que el individuo demuestre un buen nivel de discernimiento o que se cumpla la ley (como en el caso de un oficial de polic&iacute;a o un agente del FBI).</p>  <p>Los empleados que, ausent&aacute;ndose con frecuencia o acudiendo tarde a sus labores, constituyen un problema para el empleador, no necesariamente son protegidos por la ley a&uacute;n si el problema est&aacute; relacionado con una deshabilidad. Sin embargo, el empleador debe considerar si una acomodaci&oacute;n (tal como ajustar el horario de trabajo, permisos remunerados o no remunerados, o autorizaci&oacute;n para trabajar en casa) es posible y qu&eacute; tanto puede constitu&iacute;r una inconveniencia excesiva.</p>  <p>El empleador debe capacitar a su personal acerca de las estipulaciones generales de la ADA con &eacute;nfasis especial en definir las funciones esenciales de cada puesto de trabajo y los requisitos de las acomodaciones. Aprendiendo a evaluar primero al individuo y luego su deshabilidad, trabajando con la persona y su consejero, su m&eacute;dico u otras personas que tienen conocimientos en dise&ntilde;ar acomodaciones apropiadas, y respondiendo a las solicitudes de evaluar su efectividad, con estas recomendaciones estar&iacute;amos satisfaciendo las condiciones de la ADA, las necesidades pr&aacute;cticas de una persona con una deshabilidad, y las necesidades del empleador de contar con una mano de obra productiva y comprometida.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Barbara A.

Efectivamente, el departamento del Censo estima que el costo total por servicios m&eacute;dicos, de reemplazo del salario y de la productividad excedi&oacute; los $340 billones de d&oacute;lares en el a&ntilde;o 2000<sup>1</sup>, un factor que muchas compa&ntilde;&iacute;as han comenzado a tomar seriamente en consideraci&oacute;n. En &eacute;pocas con mercados laborales reducidos, ning&uacute;n empleador puede darse el lujo de perder un empleado valioso ya sea por un precario estado de salud o por una discapacidad.</p>  <p>El campo de la Administraci&oacute;n de Asuntos Relacionados con la Discapacidad (DM, siglas en ingl&eacute;s), que surgi&oacute; a mediados de la d&eacute;cada de 1980 gracias a los esfuerzos de los empleadores por reducir los costos por discapacidad de los empleados, ha tenido muchos cambios y ha crecido mucho durante esta d&eacute;cada, al menos en parte por el establecimiento de la Ley para Personas con Deshabilidades de 1990 (ADA). &ldquo;La Administraci&oacute;n de Asuntos relacionados con la Discapacidad es una serie de estrategias sobre la prevenci&oacute;n y compensaci&oacute;n de asuntos en el lugar de trabajo que busca prevenir que ocurra una discapacidad, o si &eacute;sto no es posible, realizar una r&aacute;pida intervenci&oacute;n cuando &eacute;sta suceda, utilizando un manejo de casos y servicios de rehabilitaci&oacute;n de calidad y bien coordinados, conciente de los costos y de la buena calidad, que refleje el compromiso de la organizaci&oacute;n con el futuro empleo de personas con limitaciones funcionales en el lugar de trabajo&rdquo;<sup>2</sup>. Esta definici&oacute;n fue introducida en 1992 en un libro sobre la Administraci&oacute;n de Asuntos Relacionados con la Discapacidad y que se sigue utilizando hoy en d&iacute;a, a&uacute;n cuando el alcance de los servicios e intervenciones que pueden ser &uacute;tiles para manejar y minimizar el impacto de las lesiones discapacitantes y de las enfermedades de la persona con respecto a la organizaci&oacute;n, ha crecido exponencialmente.</p>  <p>El concepto m&aacute;s importante del programa DM busca simplemente reunir todos los componentes del cuidado personal, los beneficios y el manejo del caso para que se complementen unos a otros. En su forma m&aacute;s simple la administraci&oacute;n integrada de asuntos relacionados con la discapacidad coordina los beneficios por discapacidades ocupacionales y no-ocupacionales y los programas de ausentismo y licencia remunerada, buscando una pronta reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto. Los programas DM tambi&eacute;n est&aacute;n coordinando con mayor frecuencia el cuidado de la salud, la asistencia al empleado (EAP) y el cuidado de la salud mental, el fomento de la buena salud, el control de las enfermedades, y los servicios de manejo de casos m&eacute;dicos, que buscan mejorar la salud de la fuerza laboral, reduciendo la carga administrativa, y ofreciendo una serie casi perfecta de beneficios para aquellos empleados con lesiones y enfermedades discapacitantes.</p>  <p>La integraci&oacute;n de las funciones del programa de DM es compleja, sin embargo, dado el alcance de programas, las pol&iacute;ticas y las pr&aacute;cticas de integraci&oacute;n: el manejo de datos provenientes de diversas fuentes internas y externas; entidades que ofrecen programas educativos o de salud; administraci&oacute;n de varios proveedores en el manejo de casos de seguros (o administraci&oacute;n de personas auto-aseguradas), el cuidado de la salud, y los servicios de rehabilitaci&oacute;n; y por &uacute;ltimo, aunque no en importancia, el entrenamiento de los supervisores del personal de primera l&iacute;nea en cuanto a los detalles m&aacute;s espec&iacute;ficos del manejo de la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo. La situaci&oacute;n en cada organizaci&oacute;n puede ser diferente, por lo cual un s&oacute;lo modelo de integraci&oacute;n no va a funcionar bien para todas las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as. En todo caso, todas las organizaciones deben tener en cuenta los requisitos sobre las acomodaciones razonables de acuerdo con la ADA, en el momento de dise&ntilde;ar e implementar las pol&iacute;ticas y programas sobre la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo para aquellos empleados discapacitados.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <p><sup>1</sup> Friend, D.

El Grupo de empresas especializadas en temas de la salud de Washington, en colaboraci&oacute;n con la firma de consultores en recursos humanos Watson Wyatt Worldwide, ha encuestado a un gran n&uacute;mero de empleadores desde 1996, acerca de las actividades y preocupaciones relacionadas con sus programas de DM. Los resultados de las &uacute;ltimas encuestas indicaron que el 43% de las corporaciones m&aacute;s grandes han implementado alguna forma de programa integrado de DM, en comparaci&oacute;n a un 23$ en 1996<sup>3</sup>. Con el aumento del n&uacute;mero de programas tambi&eacute;n han aumentado las expectativas de las corporaciones sobre los esfuerzos con respecto a estos programas. En 1996 la mayor&iacute;a de compa&ntilde;&iacute;as que respondieron a la encuesta del programa &ldquo;Permaneciendo en el puesto de trabajo&rdquo; indicaron que el aumento en los casos de reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto y la reducci&oacute;n de los costos de beneficios fueron las medidas m&aacute;s importantes que reflejaron el &eacute;xito del programa. Sin embargo, para 1999 las empresas declararon que el aumento en la satisfacci&oacute;n al cliente, la reducci&oacute;n en el ausentismo y el aumento de la productividad tambi&eacute;n estaban siendo observados de cerca para determinar si los esfuerzos de los programas de DM tuvieron un efecto positivo en cuanto al &eacute;xito de la empresa en general.</p>  <p>La l&iacute;nea de orientaci&oacute;n de fondo para medir la eficacia del programa de DM abarca el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA una vez las provisiones del T&iacute;tulo I de esta ley entraron en vigor en 1992, cuando muchas corporaciones se dieron cuenta de la importancia de las acomodaciones razonables como instrumento clave para la r&aacute;pida reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo, as&iacute; como para reducir la responsabilidad por discriminaci&oacute;n. En 1993 cierta organizaci&oacute;n financiera de tama&ntilde;o considerable logr&oacute; reorganizar su departamento de recursos humanos para garantizar el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA, que anteriormente eran parte del programa de Igualdad en la Oportunidad en el Empleo, esta responsabilidad pasa entonces a ser parte del Departamento de Administraci&oacute;n de Asuntos Relacionados con la Discapacidad que tambi&eacute;n coordinaba los esfuerzos de reintegro al puesto de trabajo por causas ocupacionales o no-ocupacionales<sup>4</sup>. Muchas compa&ntilde;&iacute;as grandes han reconocido que el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable mandatario bajo la ADA requiere esencialmente del mismo tipo de an&aacute;lisis con respecto a las limitaciones de origen laboral y a la modificaci&oacute;n de opciones en el puesto de trabajo que es t&iacute;pico de cualquier programa transitorio de reintegro al trabajo<sup>5</sup>. Por este motivo, el programa DM est&aacute; en una posici&oacute;n ideal para evaluar condiciones temporales o permanentes relacionadas con el puesto de trabajo.</p>  <p>Adem&aacute;s de tratar temas como los de la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo luego de sufrir una lesi&oacute;n o enfermedad, los programas DM han comenzado tambi&eacute;n a colaborar en la promoci&oacute;n de la buena salud y el manejo de la enfermedad en un esfuerzo corporativo por reducir la incidencia de condiciones de salud prevenibles y de intervenir tempranamente condiciones cr&oacute;nicas, ense&ntilde;ar t&eacute;cnicas de auto-cuidado y reducir el n&uacute;mero de episodios m&aacute;s cr&iacute;ticos que puedan requerir tiempo adicional fuera del trabajo. Con el aumento en la edad de las personas en el mercado laboral, se espera que tambi&eacute;n aumente el n&uacute;mero de casos por discapacidades en el segmento de la poblaci&oacute;n que est&aacute; trabajando, lo cual va a obligar a los empleadores a mantener el m&aacute;ximo de flexibilidad en el lugar de trabajo y de acomodar las necesidades de los empleados mayores, brind&aacute;ndoles, por ejemplo, tecnolog&iacute;a de asistencia, horarios flexibles y opciones de trabajo a distancia.</p>  <p>Los Programas de Asistencia a los empleados (EAP) tambi&eacute;n han empezado a trabajar en conjunto con los programas DM para identificar aquellos empleados con problemas de salud mental que beneficiar&iacute;an de las acomodaciones razonables en el sitio de trabajo debido las limitaciones relacionadas a este tipo de desordenes. Generalmente, los empleadores consideran los problemas de salud mental como el tipo de discapacidad m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de acomodar. Estudios llevados a cabo recientemente demostraron que al reestructurar los planes de beneficios para ofrecer una mejor cobertura de salud mental puede ser con frecuencia una forma de ahorro, al reducir el costo general relacionado con la p&eacute;rdida de d&iacute;as laborales<sup>6</sup> . Por este motivo las medidas integradas de los programas DM, en cuanto al manejo de los problemas de salud mental en el lugar de trabajo, dependen de los esfuerzos de las acomodaciones razonables que permiten a los empleados con una discapacidad mental reintegrarse al puesto, con una remuneraci&oacute;n adecuada en cuanto al costo de los tratamientos opcionales con mayor cobertura, aunque estos tratamientos tambi&eacute;n puedan ser m&aacute;s costosos. Generalmente el costo de estos tratamientos es m&aacute;s que compensado por el incremento en la productividad en el lugar de trabajo al reintegrar a los empleados con discapacidades mentales a su cargo.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\">  <p><sup>3</sup>Permaneciendo en el puesto de trabajo (Staying @ Work): Valor de las acciones a trav&eacute;s de la Gerencia Integrada de Asuntos Relacionados con la Discapacidad.

Acceso a los beneficios: Muchos programas DM coordinan el acceso de los empleados en cuanto a los beneficios de discapacidad / reemplazo de ingresos. Una vez un empleado / da se lastima o enferma, &eacute;l / ella es referido al programa DM para determinar cu&aacute;l de las posibles opciones de beneficios por discapacidades ofrecidas puede ser apropiada (licencia por enfermedad remunerada, continuaci&oacute;n del salario, programa de compensaci&oacute;n a los empleados, discapacidad a corto o largo plazo, jubilaci&oacute;n por discapacidad, etc.). Tener un s&oacute;lo punto de contacto (tal como las l&iacute;neas telef&oacute;nicas con indicativo &ldquo;800&rdquo; para llamadas de larga distancia sin costo) frecuentemente sirven para garantizar un acceso sin dificultad a los empleados que laboran en negocios que funcionan las 24 horas, o en establecimientos en diferentes partes del pa&iacute;s o alrededor del mundo con respecto a los beneficios que les corresponden una vez se encuentren deshabilitados. La inscripci&oacute;n en l&iacute;nea en los procesos de aplicaci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n ha cambiado durante los &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os, satisfaciendo las necesidades de una fuerza laboral que cada d&iacute;a depende m&aacute;s de las computadoras y que trabaja en red. Estas operaciones tambi&eacute;n sirven como puntos de recolecci&oacute;n de informaci&oacute;n sobre ausentismo y discapacidades que son utilizadas por las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as para determinar si las medidas del programa DM han tenido el impacto esperado, es decir, si se ha reducido el desperdicio del tiempo y mejorado la pronta reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo.</p>  <p>El cumplimiento con las normas del T&iacute;tulo I y el T&iacute;tulo III de la ADA puede ser mejorado al ofrecer beneficios centralizados y aumentar los esfuerzos para reducir el ausentismo. Se le garantiza a los empleados un acceso inmediato y perfecto a los beneficios, ya sea por el contacto en persona, por las l&iacute;neas telef&oacute;nicas, o de las conexiones en l&iacute;nea de la Internet. La descripci&oacute;n e informaci&oacute;n sobre los planes tambi&eacute;n se puede encontrar f&aacute;cilmente si hay preguntas sobre la cobertura. El procesamiento r&aacute;pido y eficiente de las licencias de ausentismo y de los beneficios aseguran que los esfuerzos para el reintegro al puesto de trabajo y de los esfuerzos para las acomodaciones se pongan en marcha tan pronto como su condici&oacute;n de salud lo permita.</p>  <p>2. Identificaci&oacute;n de las funciones esenciales del cargo: La ADA establece que una persona con una discapacidad debe estar calificada para llevar a cabo las &ldquo;funciones esenciales del cargo&rdquo; que &eacute;l / ella tiene o busca, antes de que se pida una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Las funciones esenciales del cargo son la base a trav&eacute;s de la cual el personal del departamento DM pueden evaluar la calificaci&oacute;n de aquellos empleados con discapacidades y determinar si existe alguna opci&oacute;n de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Una funci&oacute;n de trabajo esencial es un conjunto de tareas que abarca la mayor&iacute;a de las actividades importantes de un trabajo - no son habilidades del trabajo, tareas individuales del trabajo, o descripciones de las funciones. Por lo tanto, al hacer recomendaciones sobre la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto, el personal del departamento DM debe determinar cu&aacute;les son las funciones esenciales del cargo que se deben cumplir para que las modificaciones en el puesto sean exitosas y productivas.</p>  <p>3. Clarificaci&oacute;n de limitaciones en el puesto: Los programas DM tienen una funci&oacute;n cr&iacute;tica conectando los m&eacute;dicos, empleados con discapacidades y la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a a cargo del desarrollo de planes para el reintegro al puesto de trabajo. Normalmente las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as contratan enfermeras / manejadoras de casos (externa o internamente contratadas) para comunicarse con los m&eacute;dicos sobre la recuperaci&oacute;n y el reintegro al puesto de los empleados con discapacidades. Su funci&oacute;n es la de asegurarse que los empleados reciban tratamientos apropiados y a su debido tiempo y se indique cl&aacute;ramente y sin confusi&oacute;n si consecuentemente habr&aacute; alguna limitaci&oacute;n en el puesto, para de tal forma facilitar la modificaci&oacute;n del puesto / proceso de reintegraci&oacute;n al cargo. Incluso antes de que se presenten asuntos relacionados con acomodaciones permanentes, las asignaciones transitorias de trabajo deben tomar en consideraci&oacute;n la naturaleza y la extensi&oacute;n de las limitaciones experimentadas por los empleados que se recuperan de lesiones o de enfermedades. En caso que la duraci&oacute;n de &eacute;stas limitaciones se extienda, los esfuerzos del programa DM deben estar dirigidos a verificar y entender las restricciones y como &eacute;stas colocan a la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a; en una posici&oacute;n m&aacute;s s&oacute;lida para desarrollar acomodaciones razonables permanentes seg&uacute;n las normas de la ADA, cuando y en caso que &eacute;stas sean necesarias.</p>  <p>4. Desarrollo de modificaciones en el puesto y las opciones para el reintegro: Lo m&aacute;s esencial para el programa DM es facilitar la reintegraci&oacute;n del empleado al puesto tan pronto como lo permita su estado de salud. El empleador no solo recupera el servicio de un empleado ya entrenado, pero adem&aacute;s la reincorporaci&oacute;n al ambiente del trabajo frecuentemente acelera el proceso de recuperaci&oacute;n de los empleados con discapacidades. Las normas de la ADA sobre la no-discriminaci&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n se cumplen al ofrecer acomodaciones razonables a los empleados con discapacidades asociadas con limitaciones que reducen la habilidad del empleado para trabajar. La mayor&iacute;a de compa&ntilde;&iacute;as han creado pol&iacute;ticas de desarrollo del recurso humano, as&iacute; como materiales de entrenamiento para supervisores, con la ayuda del personal del programa de administraci&oacute;n de asuntos relacionados con la discapacidad (DM), con el objetivo de reforzar y apoyar el proceso de la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo.</p>  <p>Las opciones de reintegro al puesto / acomodaciones incluyen: la ubicaci&oacute;n en un trabajo transitorio (cambios temporales en las funciones del cargo o t&eacute;cnicas utilizadas durante periodos de recuperaci&oacute;n); trabajo modificado (cambios en las responsabilidades del cargo, horarios, m&eacute;todos o equipos); o la asignaci&oacute;n a un puesto alternativo (a otro puesto si la acomodaci&oacute;n no es posible en el puesto original). Generalmente, el personal del programa DM observa de cerca el proceso de la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable (a&uacute;n cuando se espera que las restricciones sean temporales) con el fin de tomar decisiones apropiadas sobre la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto. Inicialmente el personal DM estudia el cargo y determina las funciones esenciales. Luego &eacute;stos identifican y aclaran si existe alguna restricci&oacute;n debido a la discapacidad y generan una serie de opciones sobre la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto que aparentemente satisface las necesidades del empleado discapacitado para sobreponerse a las limitaciones. Finalmente, el personal del programa DM selecciona la opci&oacute;n que mejor encuentra un balance entre las necesidades del empleado y las expectativas de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a, para la asignaci&oacute;n productiva de responsabilidades en el puesto y de sus necesidades como empresa.</p>  <p>5. Di&aacute;logo interactivo: Una de las normas b&aacute;sicas de la ADA es la de involucrar a los empleados con discapacidades en un di&aacute;logo interactivo significativo acerca de sus opciones de trabajo. Varios juzgados han fallado a favor de demandantes apoyados por la ADA / empleados cuyos empleadores trataron de imponerles opciones de acomodaci&oacute;n sin haber llevado a cabo un di&aacute;logo interactivo con ellos que pudiera garantizar un entendimiento y llegar a un acuerdo respecto a los planes de acomodaci&oacute;n. Pero adem&aacute;s de evitar las demandas, el entablar un di&aacute;logo con los empleados sobre el proceso de su reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto tiene sentido. Los supervisores deben sentirse c&oacute;modos en cuanto a su entendimiento de la naturaleza de las limitaciones del empleado. En &uacute;ltima instancia, ambos deben tomar parte en el &eacute;xito de cualquier plan modificado de reintegro al puesto de trabajo y lo mejor es iniciar un di&aacute;logo entre ambas partes lo m&aacute;s pronto posible luego que la discapacidad de la persona sea evidente. El personal del programa DM ofrece una conexi&oacute;n entre los empleados, m&eacute;dicos, y supervisores de l&iacute;nea, para facilitar este di&aacute;logo y resolver cualquier asunto que surja durante el proceso de desarrollo del plan de reintegro al puesto.</p>  <p>La siguiente tabla representa la forma como las funciones de administraci&oacute;n de asuntos relacionados a discapacidades contribuyen con el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA.</p>  <table border=\"1\">  <tbody>  <tr><th>Funci&oacute;n de los Programas DM</th><th>Impacto en el Cumplimiento de las Normas de la ADA</th></tr>  <tr>  <td>Reintegraci&oacute;n a un puesto transitoria o modificado</td>  <td>Asstencia en la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable<br /> Analizar las funciones esenciales del puesto de trabajo<br /> Identificar las opciones en las acomodaciones al puesto,<br /> Identificar las ayudas o aparatos de asistencia<br /> especial que se puedan utilizar en el puesto</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Coordinaci&oacute;n de beneficios, discapacidad ocupacional y no-ocupacional</td>  <td>Asegurar el mismo acceso a los beneficios (t&iacute;tulo III)</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Procesamiento de aplicaciones para recibir beneficios</td>  <td>Asegurar el mismo acceso a los beneficios en un periodo de tiempo apropiado</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Manejo de casos</td>  <td>Asistencia en la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable <br /> Clarificar las limitaciones en el puesto,<br /> Identificar las opciones de acomodaciones</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Proceso interno de administraci7#243;n de asuntos relacionados con la discapacidad</td>  <td>Asistencia en la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable<br /> Ofrecer un mecanismo para poder evaluar /<br /> Financiar las acomodaciones,<br /> Promover el di&aacute;logo interactivo</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos independientes</td>  <td>Asistencia en la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable,<br /> Clarificar las limitaciones en el puesto</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Educaci7#243;n de los supervisores y m&eacute;dicos sobre el proceso de reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto</td>  <td>Promover el di&aacute;logo interactivo</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>Prevenci&oacute;n de enfermedades y aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas de seguridad</td>  <td>Asistencia en la acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, Identificar las ayudas o aparatos de asistencia en el puesto (particularmente de tipo ergon&oacute;mico)</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo pueden los programas DM garantizar el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Una encuesta de la Universidad de Cornell, (llevada a cabo en conjunto con el Grupo sobre la Salud de Washington, la Sociedad para la Administraci&oacute;n de Recursos Humanos y el gobierno federal)<sup>7</sup> llevaron a cabo una evaluaci&oacute;n comprensiva sobre las respuestas de las organizaciones del sector privado y p&uacute;blico con relaci&oacute;n a las normas de la ADA. El 45% de los empleados del sector privado (y el 42 % de las agencias gubernamentales) indicaron que han establecido programas formales de DM / programas de reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto y otro 34% de los empleados del sector privado (y el 24% de las agencias gubernamentales) indicaron que ten&iacute;an programas &ldquo;informales.&rdquo; Una serie adicional de preguntas muestra en detalle la intersecci&oacute;n de los programas DM, entre las organizaciones que indicaron los ten&iacute;an y el cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA, al preguntarle a los empleadores cu&aacute;l ha sido la contribuci&oacute;n de los programas DM en cuanto a un mejor cumplimiento de las normas de la ADA. Los resultados fueron los siguientes:</p>  <p>* 89% de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as del sector privado :y el 85% de agencias del sector federal) indicaron que los programas DM enfatizaban la importancia de la confidencialidad. Dado un aumento en la preocupaci&oacute;n sobre la privacidad en el Internet y la confidencialidad con la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica, &eacute;stos deben servir como una se&ntilde;al para motivar a que los programas de DM ayuden a crear una atm&oacute;sfera que proteja la privacidad del empleado mientras que al mismo tiempo contribuyan con la acomodaci&oacute;n de los empleados con discapacidades.</p>  <p>* El 88% de las organizaciones del sector privado (y el 73% de las agencias gubernamentales federales) han indicado que el programa DM ha mejorado la aceptaci&oacute;n de los empleados con discapacidades en el lugar de trabajo. La inclusi&oacute;n completa de las personas con discapacidades es un tema central del ADA y los programas del DM han logrado mejor&iacute;as en el sitio de trabajo al apoyar pr&aacute;cticas que normalizan el reintegro al puesto y al incluir el proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n razonable como parte del ambiente organizacional.</p>  <p>* 87% de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as del sector privado (y el 75% de las agencias del sector federal) encontraron que los programas DM aumentaron el grado de comprensi&oacute;n de los supervisores sobre el proceso de la acomodaci&oacute;n. Los empleadores han indicado que han llevado a cabo entrenamientos del personal en muchos temas sobre la discapacidad y el reintegro al puesto, muchos de los cuales incluyen o son influenciados por empleados del programa DM.</p>  <p>* El 79% de los empleadores del sector p&uacute;blico (y 71) de las organizaciones de &eacute;ste sector) han creado una infraestructura para la financiaci&oacute;n de las acomodaciones, a trav&eacute;s de sus programas DM. Muchas compa&ntilde;&iacute;as han desarrollado fondos centrales de acomodaciones para financiar ciertas modificaciones en el lugar de trabajo que puedan exceder un l&iacute;mite m&aacute;ximo determinado de antemano (generalmente varios cientos de d&oacute;lares.) Esto reduce el impacto de una acomodaci&oacute;n costosa para aquellos presupuestos departamentales reducidos, mientras brinda una forma conveniente de seguir de cerca el proceso de ofrecimiento de los servicios de acomodaci&oacute;n a trav&eacute;s de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a.</p>  <p>En orden de garantizar una aplicaci&oacute;n uniforme de los principios de las acomodaciones razonables, los programas DM han desarrollado comunicados a trav&eacute;s de la organizaci&oacute;n sobre la importancia de la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto de trabajo. Estas pol&iacute;ticas crean una &ldquo;cultura de reintegro al trabajo&rdquo; que refuerza la cooperaci&oacute;n y flexibilidad en el desarrollo de posibles opciones para el reintegro de empleados discapacitados y reduce &ldquo;la mentalidad de derecho a programa de ayuda&rdquo;, ya que los empleados tienden a pensar que tienen el <i>derecho</i> a la licencia por discapacidad como un programa de ayuda (como lo es el programa de licencia de vacaciones remuneradas.) Antes de que los programas DM fueran ext&eacute;nsamente diseminados, los empleadores apoyaban <i>involuntariamente</i> a aquellas personas que frecuentemente indicaban que estaban enfermas, recomend&aacute;ndoles y permiti&eacute;ndoles incluso a empleados con condiciones poco graves a permanecer fuera del trabajo hasta que estuvieran &ldquo;100% recuperados&rdquo;. Ahora este comportamiento se considera no s&oacute;lo como contraproducente (ya que va en contra de la perspectiva de una pronta reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto / y en contra de una adecuada perspectiva sobre la productividad) pero adem&aacute;s est&aacute; prohibido por la ADA.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>7</sup> S.

De hecho, la limitaci&oacute;n de los costos y el cumplimiento con esta ley pueden estar de com&uacute;n acuerdo. &ldquo;Hacer lo correcto&rdquo; facilita la reintegraci&oacute;n al puesto, lo cual adem&aacute;s est&aacute; relacionado con la reducci&oacute;n del costo por discapacidad en el lugar de trabajo. Aunque algunos casos presentados recientemente ante la Suprema Corte de Justicia han empezado a definir los l&iacute;mites de cobertura de la ADA, se teme que un aumento no-razonable de las medidas de la ADA pueda afectar la percepci&oacute;n, generalmente positiva, de las empresas con respecto a esta ley. Sin embargo, esto puede no ser el caso, ya que las empresas tienen todos los incentivos para continuar con el &eacute;xito de los programas DM visto en la &uacute;ltima d&eacute;cada.</p>  <p>Una vez las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as se dan cuenta de los beneficios del programa de reintegraci&oacute;n activa al puesto / programa DM, la aceptaci&oacute;n de personas con discapacidades aumentar&aacute; en el lugar de trabajo. Una vez los empleadores ensayen m&aacute;s programas para los empleados sobre beneficios de la salud dise&ntilde;ados espec&iacute;ficamente con el objetivo de mejorar el cuidado de condiciones de salud cr&oacute;nicas, las personas que anteriormente recib&iacute;an fondos de Seguridad Social por Discapacidad (Social Security Disability Insurance) podr&aacute;n encontrar que la opci&oacute;n de volver a trabajar es una alternativa m&aacute;s segura y placentera bajo el programa &ldquo;Boleto de regreso al trabajo&rdquo; / Ley del Mejoramiento de los Incentivos para Trabajar. Los esfuerzos del programa DM para mejorar el n&uacute;mero de casos que se est&aacute;n reincorporando al empleo va a traer como consecuencia mayor flexibilidad en el lugar de trabajo y va a reducir los costos por beneficios, lo cual va a hacer posible que se mejoren las perspectivas de empleo para personas con discapacidades. Adem&aacute;s, en las &aacute;reas de empleo muy demandadas y muy t&eacute;cnicas, la tecnolog&iacute;a de asistencia va a continuar expandiendo las oportunidades de empleo, a&uacute;n para aquellas personas con discapacidades m&aacute;s severas.</p>  <p>Por lo tanto, los programas DM no solo han reducido los costos monetarios y han ayudado a que los empleados discapacitados sean m&aacute;s productivos, sino que han cambiado la cultura empresarial de las compa&ntilde;&iacute;as Americanas. Los programas DM han ayudado a crear las bases fundamentales para la completa inclusi&oacute;n de las personas con discapacidades a las corporaciones Americanas.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Bruce G.

Esta legislaci&oacute;n proteje a las personas con desabilidades contra discriminaciones sobre la base de raza, sexo, religi&oacute;n u origen nacional. Las estipulaciones sobre empleo del T&iacute;tulo I proh&iacute;ben la discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de personas con desabilidades durante el reclutamiento, la clasificaci&oacute;n previa al empleo, contrataci&oacute;n, promociones, despidos y terminaci&oacute;n de contratos, as&iacute; como en relaci&oacute;n con cualquier otro t&eacute;rmino, condici&oacute;n o privilegio del empleo. El T&iacute;tulo I se aplica a los empleadores privados, a las entidades de gobiernos estatales o locales, a las agencias de empleo y a los sindicatos.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es Administraci&oacute;n con Calidad Total?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Administraci&oacute;n con Calidad Total (ACT) es una manera de llevar a cabo actividades empresariales en donde los directivos y los empleados trabajan cooper&aacute;ndose para mejorar tanto la calidad como la productividad. Es necesario que haya tres componentes para que la administraci&oacute;n con calidad total florezca en cualquier compa&ntilde;&iacute;a: administraci&oacute;n participativa, procesos de mejoramiento cont&iacute;nuo y utilizaci&oacute;n de grupos de trabajo.</p>  <p>La administraci&oacute;n participativa es un proceso de confianza y retroalimentaci&oacute;n que surge entre los directivos y los empleados. Significa ofrecer a los grupos de trabajo y a los individuos en particular las habilidades y el apoyo que necesitan para comprender mejor su actividad empresarial, su papel en el mejoramiento del proceso de producci&oacute;n y establecer su participaci&oacute;n en realizar cambios en la organizaci&oacute;n. Una encuesta Gallup realizada en 1992 revel&oacute; que el 39 por ciento de los gerentes americanos ten&iacute;an en marcha un programa de mejoramiento de la calidad y estaban satisfechos con sus resultados. El proceso de mejoramiento cont&iacute;nuo significa aceptar peque&ntilde;as ganancias incrementales como peque&ntilde;os pasos hacia la calidad total. Este enfoque facilita que los empleados ganen confianza en torno al proceso de calidad total y brinda a los directivos las oportunidades para estimular y apoyar a los empleados y a los grupos. Cada proceso es usualmente estudiado por el empleado responsable de su ejecuci&oacute;n para encontrar la manera de mejorarlo.</p>  <p>Los grupos transdisciplinarios (algunas veces llamados grupos de mejoramiento cont&iacute;nuo) se re&uacute;nen frecuentemente bajo los principios de la ACT para estudiar un &aacute;rea en particular que requiere de atenci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>?Qu? es ?Acomodaci?n Razonable? bajo la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La acomodaci?n razonable, un concepto fundamental en las disposiciones sobre empleo del T?tulo I de la ADA consiste en la modificaci?n o ajuste de un trabajo, una pr?ctica de selecci?n o un ambiente laboral que ayuda a un trabajador calificado, y que tiene una desabilidad, a participar y disfrutar de la igualdad de oportunidad en el empleo. La obligaci?n del empleador de ofrecer una acomodaci?n razonable se aplica a todos los aspectos del empleo. Este requisito puede surgir en el momento que la desabilidad de una persona o su trabajo cambien, a menos que la acomodaci?n cause al empleador una inconveniencia excesiva.</p>  <p>Este tipo de incoveniencias consiste en que la acci?n a tomar reviste una dificultad o genera un gasto significativo en relaci?n al tama?o de la compa??a, a los recursos disponibles, o a la naturaleza de la actividad empresarial. A un individuo calificado que tiene una desabilidad o a un empleado no puede neg?rseles una oportunidad de empleo solamente por la necesidad de ofrecerles acomodaci?n razonable. Si el empleador puede demostrar que el costo de la acomodaci?n generar? una inconveniencia excesiva, igualmente estar? obligado a ofrecerla si hay financiaci?n proveniente de otra fuente, por ejemplo, una agencia estatal de rehabilitaci?n vocacional, o si hay cr?dito o deducciones de impuestos para contrarrestar los costos de la acomodaci?n. Si no hay dicha financiaci?n, el individuo con la desabilidad y que est? solicitando la acomodaci?n debe tener la oportunidad de proveerla por si mismo si as? es el caso, o de pagar la porci?n que constituir?a para la operaci?n de la empresa un gasto excesivo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo se puede usar la ACT para Ayudar a Hacer Efectiva la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La administraci&oacute;n con calidad total puede usarse a la hora de hacer efectiva la ADA de tal manera que se mejoren las pr&aacute;cticas en el &aacute;rea de recursos humanos en general, adicionalmente al aumento de las oportunidades de empleo para individuos con desabilidades. Las ventajas de la ACT no s&oacute;lo se aplican exclusivamente a los Departamentos de Recursos Humanos en sus funciones de selecci&oacute;n, contrataci&oacute;n y empleo tanto en grandes como en peque&ntilde;as compa&ntilde;&iacute;as.</p>  <p>Al menos cuatro caracter&iacute;sticas de la ACT se centran en el mejoramiento del sitio de trabajo, lo que significa un beneficio para todos los empleados. Estas cuatro caracter&iacute;sticas son:</p>  <p>* incremento en el potencial productivo</p>  <p>* dise&ntilde;o universal</p>  <p>* enfoque en las fortalezas en lugar de las debilidades</p>  <p>* utilizaci&oacute;n de datos para la toma de decisiones</p>  <p>El &eacute;nfasis en el incremento del potencial productivo hace un llamado tanto al cambio en los m&eacute;todos de administraci&oacute;n en recursos humanos como a la aplicaci&oacute;n de estos cambios en el d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a, permanentemente. Bajo la ADA, al empleador puede solicit&aacute;rsele que efect&uacute;e modificaciones o ajustes en un proceso relacionado con solicitudes de empleo de tal manera que el empleado m&aacute;s calificado sea considerado para el puesto deseado. El mejoramiento de la capacidad en los procesos en materia de recursos humanos incrementa las oportunidades para las personas con desabilidades o para cualquier otro empleado potencial.</p>  <p>El concepto de dise&ntilde;o universal se adapta a la diversidad en la fuerza laboral tanto actual como futura y que incluye a personas con desabilidades. Mientras que este concepto se entiende frecuentemente en t&eacute;rminos de accesibilidad f&iacute;sica y modificaciones del medio ambiente, los mismos principios se aplican a servicios y procesos. Por ejemplo, la utilizaci&oacute;n de &iacute;conos en formularios de solicitud o en programas de computador permite que un rango mucho mayor de personas reconozca inmediatamente la informaci&oacute;n requerida.</p>  <p>El enfoque en las fortalezas en lugar de las debilidades genera el potencial para organizar las funciones de un trabajo donde se aprovechan m&aacute;s las diferencias individuales. Los procesos de contrataci&oacute;n tradicionales suelen enfatizar en requisitos que van m&aacute;s all&aacute; de las funciones esenciales de un trabajo espec&iacute;fico. Como resultado, podr&iacute;a eliminarse a empleados potenciales que tienen habilidades transferibles pero que no cumplen con todos los requisitos exigidos.</p>  <p>La utilizaci&oacute;n de datos para la toma de decisiones incluye evaluaciones de progreso y mecanismos para mejorar los procesos. Si una compa&ntilde;&iacute;a quiere aumentar la diversidad en su fuerza laboral contratando empleados con desabilidades, entonces los datos acerca del progreso en el reclutamiento, las entrevistas y la contrataci&oacute;n servir&aacute;n de retroalimentaci&oacute;n acerca de la efectividad de este nuevo enfoque en las actividades en el &aacute;rea de recursos humanos.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo podr&iacute;a Aplicarse el Proceso de Planeaci&oacute;n de la Administraci&oacute;n con Calidad Total a la Acomodaci&oacute;n Razonable?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Muchas organizaciones que trabajan bajo ACT utilizan el ciclo Planear-Ejecutar-Revisar-Actuar (PDCA) o una variaci&oacute;n de &eacute;ste. Este ciclo puede ser usado como un marco de referencia cuando los supervisores enfrentan la necesidad de realizar una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Los pasos, que se describen m&aacute;s abajo, tambi&eacute;n pueden ayudar a definir la acomodaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s apropiada para un individuo en particular.</p>  <p>Planear. El individuo con desabilidades y su supervisor deben hablar acerca de la acomodaci&oacute;n requerida, evaluar las soluciones alternativas, y seleccionar aquellas que parecen m&aacute;s razonables. El trabajador, el gerente y otros especialistas trabajar&aacute;n como un equipo. El Comit&eacute; Presidencial para la Red de Acomodaci&oacute;n Laboral para el Empleo de Personas con Desabilidades (vea el final) puede ser de gran ayuda.</p>  <p>Ejecutar. Una vez que el empleado y su supervisor llegan a un acuerdo acerca de la acomodaci&oacute;n, puede procederse a hacerla efectiva. Esto debe hacerse bajo el criterio de que la acomodaci&oacute;n puede necesitar una revisi&oacute;n y actualizaci&oacute;n en el caso de un cambio en el trabajo o en la condici&oacute;n de la desabilidad del empleado.</p>  <p>Revisar. Revise que la acomodaci&oacute;n funcione adecuadamente. Preg&uacute;ntele a la persona, observe el producto de su trabajo y observe a quienes le rodean.

Para lograrlo, debe seguirse un proceso formal para evaluar pr&aacute;cticas usuales de desempe&ntilde;o laboral y resultados, para luego compararlos con procesos de desempe&ntilde;o y resultados superiores o esperados. Por ejemplo, el entrenamiento de supervisores en t&eacute;cnicas efectivas de <i><b>benchmarking</b></i> que busca llevar m&aacute;s eficiencia a su unidad de trabajo, puede inclu&iacute;r el n&uacute;mero de accidentes de trabajo durante un trimestre en particular o el n&uacute;mero de personas con desabilidades que fueron recientemente contratadas por la empresa.

Estas ideas err&amp;#243neas pueden tener un impacto sobre las actitudes de otros y convertirse en barreras invisibles para la independencia y productividad de alguna persona. Algunos ejemplos de ideas err&amp;#243neas m&amp;#225s comunes pueden ser:  <p><b><i>El pensar que tener un aparato de TA (tecnolog&amp;#237a de asistencia) es un lujo.</i></b> Para una persona discapacitada que depende de este tipo de aparato para desempe&amp;#241ar alguna funci&amp;#243n indispensable de su puesto, o para concretar un objetivo en su vida, esta tecnolog&amp;#237a de asistencia realmente es una gran necesidad. Una computadora es un aparato necesario para que alguien pueda introducir datos, a&amp;#250n cuando esto pudiera haberse hecho con el uso de papel y l&amp;#225piz. S&amp;#243lo porque un aparato puede facilitar o hacer m&amp;#225s conveniente cierta labor, esto no lo convierte en un lujo.</p>  <p><i>\"Para la mayor&amp;#237a de personas la tecnolog&amp;#237a hace que sea m&amp;#225s f&amp;#225cil hacer ciertas cosas. Sin embargo, para las personas discapacitadas, la tecnolog&amp;#237a las hace posibles. En algunos casos, sobre todo en el lugar de trabajo, la tecnolog&amp;#237a se ha convertido en el gran ecualizador que le permite a una persona con discapacidad tener las mismas oportunidades para competir.\" (La anterior es una cita de Mary Pat Radabaugh, que trabajaba en el centro de apoyo para personas con discapacidades de la IBM).</i></p>  <p><b><i>La TA es costosa y complicada.</i></b> La mayor&amp;#237a de soluciones utilizando la TA realmente son aparatos simples y de bajo nivel en tecnolog&amp;#237a, como por ejemplo los tel&amp;#233fonos para usar sin las manos, lupas o magnificadores, o bloques de madera para elevar los escritorios o las estaciones de trabajo que pueden conseguirse en la ferreter&amp;#237a local o la tienda de provisiones para oficinas. Tambi&amp;#233n puede ser algo tan simple como reorganizar el sitio de trabajo.</p>  <p>A&amp;#250n cuando un \"costo o carga excesiva\", en t&amp;#233rminos de las normas de la ADA, significa que proveer una acomodaci&amp;#243n obligar&amp;#237a al empleador a incurrir \"un costo o carga significativamente excesivo\", de acuerdo a La red de acomodaci&amp;#243n para el empleo (JAN), el 80% de las acomodaciones sugeridas tienen un costo menor a los $500. El costo de la TA puede ser compartido entre el empleador, la persona, o una tercera parte a pagar, ya sea el plan de seguro de salud suministrado al empleado por el empleador, el plan de compensaci&amp;#243n al trabajador, los servicios estatales de rehabilitaci&amp;#243n (tambi&amp;#233n conocidos como rehabilitaci&amp;#243n vocacional), las organizaciones de car&amp;#225cter filantr&amp;#243pico, y los programas de prestamos de la TA. Adem&amp;#225s, los cr&amp;#233ditos fiscales y las deducciones fiscales tambi&amp;#233n se pueden ofrecer para satisfacer las acomodaciones razonables (puede dirigirse a la secci&amp;#243n de recursos al final de este documento).</p>  <p><b><i>Muchas veces el profesional sabe que es lo mejor. </i></b>Las personas que utilizan la TA frecuentemente tienen la experiencia y conocimiento para determinar las mejores soluciones en cuanto a sus necesidades personales. Es importante que los consumidores y los profesionales trabajen en conjunto para encontrar la mejor soluci&amp;#243n en cuanto a la TA.</p>  </div>  <h2>Medidas para asegurar la mejor utilizaci&amp;#243n de las acomodaciones de la TA</h2>  <div class=\"section\">Deber&amp;#237a seguir los siguientes pasos para asegurarse que se ofrezca la acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable m&amp;#225s apropiada:  <ul>  <li>Debe crear una asociaci&amp;#243n entre los empleadores (o proveedores de servicios) y la persona discapacitada.</li>  <li>Conc&amp;#233ntrese en la habilidad en vez de la discapacidad.

Generalmente la persona con la discapacidad debe informarle al empleador si necesita alguna acomodaci&amp;#243n.</p>  <p>El empleador debe confirmar con el empleado acerca de cual tipo de acomodaci&amp;#243n le permitir&amp;#237a (a &amp;#233l o ella) desempe&amp;#241ar las funciones esenciales del puesto.

Desde la creaci&amp;#243n de la agencia en 1971 las muertes ocupacionales han sido reducidas a la mitad y las lesiones han disminuido en un 40%. El Congreso de los EE.UU. cre&amp;#243 la OSHA bajo la Ley de la seguridad ocupacional y la salud (OSH), y fue instituida como ley el 29 de diciembre de 1970<sup>3</sup>.</p>  <p>La administraci&amp;#243n de la Ley de Seguridad Ocupacional y la Salud (OSHA) esta basada en la premisa que todo empleado tiene el derecho de trabajar en un lugar libre de riesgos o peligros reconocidos. Una vez se haya identificado un peligro o riesgo potencial, la Administraci&amp;#243n de la Seguridad Ocupacional y la Salud (OSHA), que es una divisi&amp;#243n del Departamento de Trabajo de los EE.UU., ha desarrollado algunos niveles de calidad para determinar ciertas pr&amp;#225cticas o condiciones en el lugar de trabajo. En contraste a otras regulaciones sobre el empleo, los requisitos de la OSHA se aplican universalmente a todo el personal, sin importar el volumen de ventas que estos lleven a cabo o del n&amp;#250mero total de empleados.</p>  <p>Una vez implementado un nivel de calidad, el Departamento de trabajo puede decidir cuales sitios ser&amp;#225n inspeccionados, por solicitud de un empleado en un sitio en particular o por criterio de la OSHA. Estas inspecciones se hacen con la autorizaci&amp;#243n previa del empleador, y de acuerdo a las directrices de la OSHA. Una violaci&amp;#243n de alguna norma de calidad se puede penalizar con alg&amp;#250n tipo de reducci&amp;#243n ordenada por el Gobierno, con multas dependiendo del tama&amp;#241o de la empresa, la seriedad de la violaci&amp;#243n, la buena fe del empleador, y los antecedentes de otras violaciones en el pasado. Las violaciones que hayan causado el fallecimiento de un empleado pueden ser penalizadas bajo las normas de la ley penal.<sup>4</sup></p>  <p>Algunos requisitos de la OSHA cubren las estipulaciones de la ADA. Frecuentemente se le har&amp;#225n muchas preguntas al especialista del Departamento de recursos Humanos sobre la interceptaci&amp;#243n de estas leyes en temas como los ex&amp;#225menes y evaluaciones de empleados, la confidencialidad de los expedientes m&amp;#233dicos, y las acomodaciones razonables.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup> Si desea obtener mas informaci&amp;#243n vaya a la p&amp;#225gina electr&amp;#243nica de la Administraci&amp;#243n de salud y seguridad ocupacional en www.osha.govv  <p><sup>4</sup>29 U.S.C.

La ADA ha establecido limitaciones sobre los ex&amp;#225menes que se le pueden hacer a los empleados. En caso de que una persona (o clase de personas) con alguna discapacidad sea rechazada por un examen u otros niveles de calidad relacionados a la calificaci&amp;#243n, el empleador debe demostrar que la prueba o el nivel de calidad esta relacionado al puesto mismo y de acuerdo a la necesidad de la empresa, y que no se puede cumplir con este nivel de calidad aun usando una acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable. En la mayor&amp;#237a de casos, el riesgo de sufrir una lesi&amp;#243n en el futuro no satisfacer&amp;#225 este nivel de calidad requerido por la ADA. La ADA tampoco permite que un empleador haga preguntas m&amp;#233dicas o que requiera ex&amp;#225menes f&amp;#237sicos sin haber hecho una oferta de trabajo, y establece restricciones sobre las preguntas y ex&amp;#225menes m&amp;#233dicos luego de haberse hecho la oferta, pero sin haber empezado a trabajar. Una vez la persona ha sido contratada y se considere un empleado/da, cualquier pregunta de tipo m&amp;#233dico debe estar relacionada al puesto mismo y de acuerdo a las necesidades de la empresa. Todas estas restricciones a los ex&amp;#225menes y preguntas m&amp;#233dicas buscan prevenir cualquier tipo de discriminaci&amp;#243n por discapacidad.</p>  <p>La Ley OSHA, en contraste a la ADA, requiere que los empleadores observen y eval&amp;#250en cuidadosamente una variedad de situaciones para garantizar la seguridad. Por ejemplo, empleados expuestos a niveles altos de ruido deben estar incluidos en un programa de ex&amp;#225menes audiom&amp;#233tricos que incluye, entre otros, los ex&amp;#225menes auditivos anuales.<sup>5</sup> Los l&amp;#237mites impuestos por la ADA sobre ex&amp;#225menes a empleados u otras personas solicitando puestos podr&amp;#237an inicialmente parecer en conflicto con las necesidades de la Ley OSHA en cuanto a la raz&amp;#243n de hacer estos ex&amp;#225menes as&amp;#237 como el progreso de los objetivos sobre la seguridad en el lugar de trabajo. Sin embargo, las regulaciones de la ADA reconocen que si las acusaciones de acci&amp;#243n discriminatoria por parte del empleador fueron tomadas para cumplir con los requisitos de otra ley o regulaci&amp;#243n federal, el empleador puede usar esto como defensa al cargo de discriminaci&amp;#243n. La respuesta a esta defensa del empleador puede hacerse demostrando que es s&amp;#243lo un pretexto, o demostrando que el nivel de calidad federal no requer&amp;#237a la medida discriminatoria o que se podr&amp;#237a haber cumplido en tal forma de no excluir a nadie.<sup>6</sup> Una encuesta llevada a cabo sobre estos casos jur&amp;#237dicos no ha revelado ning&amp;#250n caso importante que demuestre la existencia de un conflicto entre las limitaciones de la ADA sobre preguntas y ex&amp;#225menes m&amp;#233dicos y los requisitos para las pruebas de la OSHA, lo cual lleva a este autor a concluir que los diferentes objetivos y requisitos de la ADA y la OSHA est&amp;#225n siendo interpretados arm&amp;#243nicamente basados en un sentido com&amp;#250n. Los profesionales del Departamento de Recursos Humanos con vasto conocimientos sobre estas leyes pueden contribuir a la pronta resoluci&amp;#243n de estos conflictos, determinando si los requisitos de ambas leyes pueden ser cumplidos, o si la defensa conflictiva de la ADA se puede aplicar.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>5</sup> Dir&amp;#237jase a 29 C.F.R. secci&amp;#243n 1910.95.<br /> <sup>6</sup>29 C.F.R.

Toda informaci&amp;#243n obtenida en un examen m&amp;#233dico, una vez se haya hecho la oferta del puesto, debe ser recopilada y mantenida en formularios separados, en expedientes m&amp;#233dicos por separado, y debe ser tratada como un registro m&amp;#233dico confidencial. Los empleadores deben tomar las medidas necesarias para garantizar la confidencialidad de la informaci&amp;#243n m&amp;#233dica del empleado, incluyendo mantenerla en un expediente en un gabinete bajo llave, aparte de los archivos personales, y se deber&amp;#237a designar a cierta persona o personas especificas autorizadas para tener acceso a los expedientes m&amp;#233dicos. Si es necesario, los empleadores pueden revelar el contenido de estos registros acerca de posibles restricciones en el puesto o las acomodaciones requeridas a los supervisores y administradores, al personal de primeros auxilios, y a los oficiales gubernamentales investigando casos acerca de posible violaci&amp;#243n contra alguna norma de la ADA u otras leyes sobre discriminaci&amp;#243n por discapacidad.

Lugares de trabajo en empresas consideradas con un menor nivel de riesgo, como las de ventas, servicios, financias, seguros de bienes y ra&amp;#237ces est&amp;#225n exentas del requisito sobre el mantenimiento del registro.</p>  <p>La OSHA recientemente ha tomado una nueva decisi&amp;#243n con respecto al mantenimiento de registros, buscando mejorar el sistema utilizado por los empleadores en el seguimiento y la documentaci&amp;#243n por escrito de las lesiones y enfermedades en el lugar de trabajo.<sup>8</sup> Los formularios 300 y 301 de la OSHA contienen informaci&amp;#243n sobre la salud de los empleados, la cual deber&amp;#225 ser utilizada de tal forma que proteja dentro de lo posible su confidencialidad, mientras que sea utilizada por razones de la seguridad ocupacional y la salud. El personal encargado de poner en pr&amp;#225ctica las normas de la OSHA tambi&amp;#233n puede evaluar los expedientes m&amp;#233dicos s&amp;#243lo si su motivaci&amp;#243n es verificar si el empleador esta cumpliendo con los requisitos del mantenimiento de los registros en expedientes m&amp;#233dicos de cierto nivel de calidad ocupacional. Sin embargo, esta regulaci&amp;#243n de la OSHA establece que este tipo de experimento deber&amp;#225 llevarse a cabo en el lugar mismo de trabajo, y que el personal encargado de garantizar el cumplimiento de las normas de la OSHA no podr&amp;#225 poner por escrito, ni sacar del lugar de trabajo, informaci&amp;#243n proveniente de un expediente m&amp;#233dico, a menos que esta documentaci&amp;#243n demuestre el cumplimiento de esta ley.</p>  <p>Adem&amp;#225s, la OSHA ha determinado que en ciertas circunstancias el acceso al expediente m&amp;#233dico del empleado va a ser importante para asegurar que la agencia pueda llevar a cabo sus funciones legales. Debido al gran inter&amp;#233s sobre mantener en cada caso la privacidad personal, la autoridad de la OSHA ha decidido que el acceso a la informaci&amp;#243n medica de cierto empleado que pueda ser identificado s&amp;#243lo tendr&amp;#237a lugar luego de que la agencia haya determinado cuidadosamente la necesidad de esta informaci&amp;#243n, y solo utilizando los m&amp;#233todos necesarios para proteger la privacidad de la persona.<sup>9</sup></p>  <p>En t&amp;#233rminos generales, las regulaciones de la OSHA parecen tener inquietudes sobre los requisitos de confidencialidad de la informaci&amp;#243n m&amp;#233dica del empleado de tal forma que est&amp;#233 de acuerdo con los requisitos de confidencialidad de la ADA. El personal del Departamento de Recursos Humanos debe tratar de guiar a los empleadores con respecto al cumplimiento de los requisitos de la OSHA, y que dentro de lo posible, cumplan con las previsiones de la confidencialidad. Sin embargo, el personal de la OSHA y otras personas designadas por sus regulaciones, incluyendo los representantes del Instituto nacional para la seguridad ocupacional y la salud (NIOSH), va a insistir en tener acceso a los expedientes m&amp;#233dicos que considere vitales a su objetivo.<sup>10</sup> Aunque la ADA no especifica que estas partes pueden tener acceso a los expedientes m&amp;#233dicos confidenciales, las leyes conflictivas federales y la defensa de las regulaciones de la ADA proteger&amp;#225n a un empleado que permita que los representantes de la OSHA tengan acceso a la agencia, de acuerdo a las normas de la ley federal.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>7</sup>29 C.F.R.

En caso que la OSHA requiera cierto nivel de calidad, el empleador debe satisfacerlo. Sin embargo, un empleador no puede rechazar a una persona con una discapacidad como resultado de un examen de salud y seguridad. La ADA requiere que el empleador considere la posibilidad de ofrecerle al empleado una acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable para que pueda desempe&amp;#241ar su puesto actual de acuerdo a los requisitos de la OSHA. Por ejemplo, si un examen audiom&amp;#233trico requerido por la OSHA demuestra que un empleado ha sufrido una p&amp;#233rdida auditiva por exposici&amp;#243n a equipos ruidosos, el empleador podr&amp;#237a pensar en despedir al empleado si lo considera como un riesgo potencial, o tal vez transferirlo a otro puesto. La ADA requiere que el empleador considere inicialmente ofrecerle una acomodaci&amp;#243n, como un aparato para reducir los ruidos que le permitir&amp;#237a a esta persona seguir trabajando en su puesto actual, y s&amp;#243lo reasignarlo a otro puesto si no existe otra alternativa.</p>  <p>Ocasionalmente las regulaciones de la OSHA no permitir&amp;#225n cierto tipo espec&amp;#237fico de acomodaci&amp;#243n. Por ejemplo, los requisitos sobre respiradores de la OSHA son claros y espec&amp;#237ficos. El empleador no est&amp;#225 obligado a mantener a un empleado trabajando en cierto puesto donde se requiere que use un respirador si esta persona no lo puede usar. Sin embargo, la ADA seguir&amp;#237a requiriendo que el empleador considere la transferencia de este empleado a un puesto vacante equivalente.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191En t&amp;#233rminos de las normas de la ADA, Qu&amp;#233 se considera como un ?riesgo directo? y cual es su relaci&amp;#243n con la Ley OSHA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Algunos empleadores tienen la inquietud de que un empleado con una discapacidad pueda ocasionar un riesgo de seguridad a s&amp;#237 mismo, o a los colegas o clientes. La ADA toma en cuenta esta inquietud s&amp;#243lo en caso que se base en pruebas claras y documentadas que demuestren que esta persona es considerada un ?riesgo directo? a s&amp;#237 mismo u otros debido a la naturaleza del puesto y las caracter&amp;#237sticas espec&amp;#237ficas de su discapacidad.</p>  <p>Para determinar si una persona se puede considerar como un riesgo directo, incluyendo aquellas con enfermedades contagiosas, se deben considerar los siguientes factores: (1) El periodo de duraci&amp;#243n de este riesgo; (2) La naturaleza y severidad de un posible da&ntilde; (3) La posibilidad que el da&amp;#241o ocurra; y (4) Que tan seguro es el posible da&amp;#241o. A&amp;#250n cuando la persona pueda considerarse propensa a poder causar alg&amp;#250n da&amp;#241o, parte de las consideraciones sobre acomodaciones razonables incluyen hacer un an&amp;#225lisis sobre si la persona puede recibir alguna acomodaci&amp;#243n que elimine el riesgo directo o lo reduzca a un nivel aceptable.</p>  <p>Es extremadamente dif&amp;#237cil para el empleador cumplir con el nivel de calidad del riesgo directo. Sin embargo, los empleadores no est&amp;#225n obligados a hacer un an&amp;#225lisis del riesgo directo si un nivel de calidad de la OSHA requiere que un empleado sea removido de cierto puesto por razones de salud y seguridad. De nuevo, el empleador siempre debe considerar si existe una acomodaci&amp;#243n efectiva que permitir&amp;#237a que el empleado cumpla con las regulaciones de la OSHA, y si no es posible, debe considerar la reasignaci&amp;#243n del empleado a un puesto vacante.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Cu&amp;#225les otros especialistas pueden ayudar al personal del Departamento de Recursos Humanos con el cumplimiento de los requisitos de la OSHA y la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los empleadores de organizaciones de mayor tama&amp;#241o pueden contratar a sus propios expertos para ayudarles en temas sobre la seguridad y la salud, incluyendo personas especializadas espec&amp;#237ficamente en la salud y seguridad, ergonomistas, especialistas en salud ocupacional, fisioterapeutas, y los terapeutas ocupacionales. Los empleadores de organizaciones peque&amp;#241as pueden contratar estos servicios de acuerdo a sus necesidades a trav&amp;#233s de agencias externas. Frecuentemente, el factor m&amp;#225s importante para el personal de recursos humanos es determinar cual profesional deber&amp;#225 ser llamado, ya que frecuentemente esa persona es la m&amp;#225s adecuada para asistir a los supervisores a resolver estos temas. El profesional de los Recursos Humanos colaborar&amp;#225 muy de cerca con estos proveedores de servicios aplicando o utilizando sus consejos dentro de la infraestructura de los requisitos de la ADA y la OSHA.</p>  <p>Por ejemplo, una lesi&amp;#243n ortop&amp;#233dica dorsal(muscular/ &amp;#243sea) es el tipo de discapacidad con el mayor n&amp;#250mero de demandas presentadas ante la EEOC por presunta violaci&amp;#243n sobre la discriminaci&amp;#243n en t&amp;#233rminos de la ADA (aproximadamente 16% de las demandas iniciadas hasta la fecha).<sup>11</sup> A los especialistas del Departamento de recursos humanos frecuentemente se les hacen preguntas sobre acomodaciones y la salud y seguridad en t&amp;#233rminos de personas con lesiones musculares o de los huesos.<sup>12</sup> Los supervisores o los especialistas en Recursos Humanos pueden ser aconsejados por un ergonomista, fisioterapeuta o terapeuta ocupacional, higienista industrial, o un especialista en la salud y la seguridad. Los ergonomistas integran conocimientos de las ciencias humanas para encontrar la igualdad a los puestos de trabajos, sistemas, productos y medios ambientes con las habilidades y limitaciones f&amp;#237sicas y mentales de las personas.<sup>13</sup> El ergonomista utiliza informaci&amp;#243n sobre las personas, como su tama&amp;#241o (estatura, etc.), habilidad para evaluar la informaci&amp;#243n y decidir, la habilidad para observar y escuchar, y la habilidad para trabajar en condiciones con temperaturas extremas, para encontrar la igualdad entre las personas y los puestos de trabajos espec&amp;#237ficos.<sup>14&gt;/sup&gt;</sup></p>  <p>Los fisioterapeutas son profesionales que eval&amp;#250an y tratan a personas con problemas de salud causados por lesiones o enfermedades. Los fisioterapeutas eval&amp;#250an la capacidad del movimiento en coyunturas, la fortaleza muscular y la resistencia, el funcionamiento del coraz&amp;#243n y los pulmones, y la habilidad de llevar a cabo actividades necesarias en la vida cotidiana. <sup>15</sup></p>  <p>Los terapeutas ocupacionales eval&amp;#250an y tratan a personas con lesiones, enfermedades, limitaciones cognoscitivas, deficiencias psico-sociales, enfermedades mentales, limitaciones en el desarrollo del aprendizaje, discapacidades f&amp;#237sicas, u otros desordenes o condiciones. La evaluaci&amp;#243n y la intervenci&amp;#243n del terapeuta ocupacional esta basada en el nivel de funcionamiento de la persona, quien lleva a cabo una evaluaci&amp;#243n de los componentes de su desempe&amp;#241o y el contexto de este desempe&amp;#241o. <sup>16</sup></p>  <p>La responsabilidad del higienista industrial es tratar de garantizar que el sitio de trabajo est&amp;#233 libre de peligros dentro de lo posible, y que los trabajadores en la comunidad en general est&amp;#233n protegidos contra cualquier riesgo a la salud. Algunas &amp;#225reas en la que un higienista industrial puede ayudar incluyen: llevar a cabo pruebas para buscar y posiblemente remover materiales t&amp;#243xicos en el medio ambiente de trabajo; ayudar a reducir la cifra de discapacidades causadas por movimientos repetitivos y prolongados, como escribiendo a m&amp;#225quina usando un teclado o estar sentado todo el d&amp;#237a frente a un escritorio; y establecer l&amp;#237mites en cuanto a los niveles de exposici&amp;#243n y ofrecer directrices sobre el control de sustancias qu&amp;#237micas, el ruido, y la radiaci&amp;#243n en el lugar de trabajo.</p>  <p>Para informaci&amp;#243n adicional sobre los servicios ofrecidos por los higienistas industriales y las credenciales requeridas para estos, as&amp;#237 como para los ingenieros de seguridad, puede contactar las asociaciones profesionales relevantes., , <sup>17, 18, 19</sup> Es probable que al especialista en Recursos humanos se le hagan muchas preguntas sobre discapacidades relacionadas a la salud mental. Frecuentemente los empleadores indican alguna inquietud sobre ciertas personas con discapacidades siqui&amp;#225tricas o que hayan recibido tratamientos que puedan presentar alg&amp;#250n riesgo relacionado a la seguridad.

El mediador facilita la conversaci&amp;#243n, promulga la comunicaci&amp;#243n, y utiliza una variedad de destrezas y m&amp;#233todos para asistir a ambas partes interesadas en llegar a un acuerdo, pero el mediador no tiene poder para hacer decisiones. Este proceso es voluntario y confidencial.</p>  <p>Aun cuando muchos piensan que la mediaci&amp;#243n s&amp;#243lo se puede usar luego de haberse presentado una queja formal o se haya iniciado un pleito, las medidas de la mediaci&amp;#243n tambi&amp;#233n pueden ser apropiadas y efectivamente aplicadas al tener la primera noci&amp;#243n de un posible problema o conflicto que todav&amp;#237a no llegue al nivel de una demanda legal. (1) Este art&amp;#237culo va explorar las medidas y procesos de la mediaci&amp;#243n, a la vez que tratar&amp;#225 algunas consideraciones especiales relacionadas con la mediaci&amp;#243n de casos que puedan surgir en relaci&amp;#243n a la Ley para personas con discapacidades (ADA.) El T&amp;#237tulo I de la ADA proh&amp;#237be la discriminaci&amp;#243n en el empleo contra una persona calificada que tiene alguna discapacidad.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Cu&amp;#225les son los otros tipos de Alternativas para la Resoluci&amp;#243n de Conflictos (ADR siglas en Ingl&amp;#233s)?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Adem&amp;#225s de la mediaci&amp;#243n otros tipos de ADR incluyen: Someterse al arbitraje, los juicios menores, la evaluaci&amp;#243n neutral temprana, el juicio privado, y los paneles de evaluaci&amp;#243n. Todas estas formas de ADR, con la excepci&amp;#243n de la mediaci&amp;#243n, son parecidas al modelo del litigio. Esto implica que todos utilizan un sistema de abogac&amp;#237a (abogados) que representan los casos respectivos de cada uno de sus clientes ante una tercera parte, el cual es similar a un juez y quien toma la decisi&amp;#243n. El arbitraje es frecuentemente un proceso de decisi&amp;#243n legalmente v&amp;#225lido en el que el &amp;#225rbitro escucha las pruebas y dicta un fallo. En la evaluaci&amp;#243n por medio de un experto neutral, los abogados presentan sus casos a un tercer abogado que tiene muchos a&amp;#241os de experiencia. Este experto ofrece una opini&amp;#243n informal, enfatizando los puntos con mayor o menor solidez en los casos; su prop&amp;#243sito es darle a las partes una base m&amp;#225s real para llegar a un acuerdo fuera del juzgado. El juicio privado es id&amp;#233ntico al litigio regular, pero utiliza personas que anteriormente fueron jueces en juzgados privados. Los paneles de evaluaci&amp;#243n son utilizados como expertos neutrales para evaluar los casos en su etapa inicial, buscando llegar a un acuerdo o que se descarten los casos que no parezcan tener posibilidad de &amp;#233xito. Las ADR, incluyendo la mediaci&amp;#243n, son promulgadas por muchos juzgados. En algunas jurisdicciones se requiere por razones de &amp;#233tica que los abogados les informen a sus clientes sobre las diferentes opciones relacionadas con las ADR. <sup>1</sup></p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup> Sin embargo, la persona debe tener en cuenta el periodo en que una demanda legal debe ser iniciada (estatutos de limitaci&amp;#243n) la cual no se va a continuar durante las etapas previas a la presentaci&amp;#243n de cargos o la mediaci&amp;#243n de la queja.</div>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Por qu&amp;#233 la mediaci&amp;#243n s&amp;#233 esta volviendo tan popular?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La mediaci&amp;#243n es la forma de ADR con la tasa de crecimiento m&amp;#225s alta. La mediaci&amp;#243n s&amp;#233 esta utilizando cada vez m&amp;#225s en el contexto del empleo, incluyendo los casos relacionados al T&amp;#237tulo I (empleo) de la ADA. Tambi&amp;#233n s&amp;#233 esta utilizando para resolver demandas relacionadas al T&amp;#237tulo II de la ADA (Transporte) y al T&amp;#237tulo III (Acomodaciones p?blicas).</p>  <p>La mediaci&amp;#243n se ha convertido en una forma popular de ADR debido a que este proceso es voluntario, confidencial, eficiente, y mucho menos costoso que un litigio. Este proceso tambi&amp;#233n lleva a las partes a tener m&amp;#225s control sobre el resultado. Adem&amp;#225s, la participaci&amp;#243n en la mediaci&amp;#243n no lleva a una renuncia sobre los derechos por cierta decisi&amp;#243n legal o del proceso a seguir, al llegar a un acuerdo sobre la utilizaci&amp;#243n de mediaci&amp;#243n tambi&amp;#233n se permite que las partes puedan buscar otras medidas en cualquier momento. La mediaci&amp;#243n tambi&amp;#233n permite que todos sean escuchados y que las partes puedan ser tan creativas como lo deseen en la formulaci&amp;#243n de un acuerdo que les convenga a cada una de ellas.</p>  <p>Adem&amp;#225s, muchas organizaciones est&amp;#225n utilizando la mediaci&amp;#243n o las medidas mediadoras dentro de estas para resolver conflictos sobre el empleo tan pronto como sea posible. A trav&amp;#233s de la mediaci&amp;#243n los problemas frecuentemente son resueltos antes de que estos tengan un impacto sobre la armon&amp;#237a en la oficina o la funcionalidad productiva de los empleados. Tambi&amp;#233n ayuda a evitar los litigios y los costos asociados con estos.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191C&amp;#243mo difiere la mediaci&amp;#243n de la litigaci&amp;#243n?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La mediaci&amp;#243n es muy diferente al proceso adversario de la litigaci&amp;#243n o de someterse al arbitraje y, al menos en teor&amp;#237a, reduce la hostilidad proveniente de ambas. La mediaci&amp;#243n no juzga la culpabilidad ni la inocencia, ni decide quien est&amp;#225 en lo correcto o incorrecto. Por lo contrario, su objetivo es llevar a las partes a tener la oportunidad de:</p>  <ol>  <li>Dar rienda suelta y calmar las emociones,</li>  <li>Aclarar mal entendidos,</li>  <li>Determinar intereses o preocupaciones subyacentes</li>  <li>Encontrar &amp;#225reas comunes, y sobre todo,</li>  <li>Incorporar estas &amp;#225reas en soluciones producidas por las mismas partes.</li>  </ol>  <p>La litigaci&amp;#243n generalmente hace la siguiente pregunta: \"&amp;#191Qui&amp;#233n es m&amp;#225s culpable y cuanto debe ella / &amp;#233l perder?\" Por otro lado, la mediaci&amp;#243n hace preguntas muy diferentes, como: \"Nos estamos divorciando. &amp;#191C&amp;#243mo deberemos continuar con nuestro papel de padres de familia con respecto a nuestros hijos?\" &amp;#243, \"&amp;#191El carro que vendimos estaba defectuoso, que haremos con respecto a este problema del transporte?\" &amp;#243, \" &amp;#191Qu&amp;#233 necesita hacerse para mejorar nuestras relaciones en el empleo o mejorar el ambiente de trabajo? (es decir, cuando se siente limitado debido a comentarios o acciones discriminatorias)\".</p>  <p>Al concentrarse en los intereses de ambas partes, en vez de s&amp;#243lo sus posiciones declaradas, la mediaci&amp;#243n frecuentemente puede llegar a soluciones en donde nadie pierde, donde ambas partes est&amp;#225n satisfechas con el acuerdo que han ayudado a redactar.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Qu&amp;#233 hace el mediador?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El mediador, en contraste a un juez, un examinador en una audiencia, o un &amp;#225rbitro, no tiene poder legal para dictar una sentencia o decisi&amp;#243n legal o adjudicar una indemnizaci&amp;#243n. El mediador tampoco puede tomar el lado de una de las partes, ni puede actuar como terapeuta o consejero, aunque el proceso de mediaci&amp;#243n puede ser terap&amp;#233utico. Por lo contrario, el mediador es una tercera parte neutral que permite que la otras puedan entablar conversaciones sobre sus problemas, facilitando un intercambio de ideas y mejorando la comunicaci&amp;#243n. Ambas partes deben confiar en la neutralidad del mediador; la efectividad del mediador depende de la confianza de las partes.</p>  <p>Los mejores mediadores tienen buen sentido com?n, la habilidad de convencer y de facilitar la resoluci&amp;#243n de problemas. Un mediador que es capaz de facilitar debe mantenerse completamente neutral y no hacer recomendaciones que puedan revelar como &amp;#233l o ella se siente con respecto a un conflicto. Por lo contrario, el mediador trata de reconciliar puntos de vista opuestos buscando aquellos que tengan en com?n. Aunque los estilos de los mediadores var&amp;#237an much&amp;#237simo en una mediaci&amp;#243n, el mediador usualmente:</p>  <ul>  <li>Explica el proceso y desarrolla un ambiente que los lleva a la negociaci&amp;#243n para lograr resolver los problemas.</li>  <li>Le da a cada una de las partes la oportunidad de ofrecer su versi&amp;#243n del caso, expresar sus emociones, y de sentirse que tanto el mediador como la otra parte los han o&amp;#237do.</li>  <li>Permite la recopilaci&amp;#243n de toda la informaci&amp;#243n disponible sobre los asuntos y los intereses de ambas partes escuchando y haciendo preguntas en sesiones conjuntas o por separado.</li>  <li>Ayuda identificar asuntos y encontrar puntos en com?n.</li>  <li>Fomenta que las partes lleven a cabo sesiones para desarrollar ideas y crear opciones.</li>  <li>Ayuda a las partes evaluar y reducir el n?mero de opciones, incluyendo que las partes tomen decisiones racionales entre llegar a un acuerdo o iniciar una demanda.</li>  <li>Ayuda, si es solicitada, en desarrollar un memorando de comprensi&amp;#243n sobre los puntos m&amp;#225s importantes en com?n (los acuerdos finales generalmente ser&amp;#225n manejados por los abogados en casos complejos; en casos simples como los pleitos del tribunal de casos menores, el mediador puede redactar el acuerdo final).</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191C&amp;#243mo puede mi empresa usar la mediaci&amp;#243n para prevenir un litigio?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Actualmente algunas organizaciones tienen mediadores o especialistas en la resoluci&amp;#243n de conflictos de planta a los cuales los empleados pueden recurrir para la resoluci&amp;#243n de conflictos. En la mayor&amp;#237a de los casos, los especialistas del Departamento de recursos humanos (R.H.) han sido entrenados para usar t&amp;#233cnicas de mediaci&amp;#243n en casos cotidianos relacionados con conflictos entre empleados, o entre supervisores y empleados. Muchas de las medidas de mediaci&amp;#243n discutidas en la secci&amp;#243n anterior son utilizadas por los especialistas en la resoluci&amp;#243n de conflictos de planta y los especialistas del Departamento de recursos humanos (muchas veces son uno mismo) mientras ayudan a los empleados y / o a los supervisores a tratar de resolver los conflictos.</p>  <p>Las t&amp;#233cnicas de la mediaci&amp;#243n pueden ser utilizadas en una manera informal y no estructurada como un di&amp;#225logo o serie de di&amp;#225logos. Como alternativa, se puede invitar a las partes a sostener una mediaci&amp;#243n sobre conflictos por medio de una persona en la compa&amp;#241&amp;#237a que sirva como mediador. En caso de que no se encuentre alguna persona dentro de la organizaci&amp;#243n con habilidades de mediador, el empleador puede contratar a un mediador externo para que se re?na con las partes con el fin de resolver los conflictos.</p>  <p>Asuntos que pueden ser apropiados para la mediaci&amp;#243n pueden variar desde un conflicto interpersonal de los que no se tengan conocimiento legal (dos empleados que no se llevan bien y est&amp;#225n afectando la armon&amp;#237a dentro de la oficina), hasta una demanda legal especifica que no se ha iniciado. En general, se aconseja el di&amp;#225logo y la mediaci&amp;#243n acerca de los problemas lo m&amp;#225s pronto posible, antes que estos se intensifiquen y lleguen a la fase del litigio.</p>  <p>En aquellos casos en que se ha cometido una falta de car&amp;#225cter legal, un acuerdo de mediaci&amp;#243n presentado por escrito acompa&amp;#241ado por un reembolso generalmente ser&amp;#237a redactado y firmado (lea sobre esto m&amp;#225s adelante.) En otros casos, la funci&amp;#243n m&amp;#225s importante de la mediaci&amp;#243n es la de ventilar los asuntos en cuesti&amp;#243n. A veces una disculpa junto con un acuerdo verbal de llevar a cabo algunos cambios, es todo lo que es necesario. En algunas ocasiones las partes pueden preferir un acuerdo por escrito.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Qu&amp;#233 se puede acordar en un convenio logrado por medio de la mediaci&amp;#243n?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Una soluci&amp;#243n creativa es el sello oficial de la mediaci&amp;#243n. En un acuerdo por medio de la mediaci&amp;#243n acerca de una demanda legal, las partes pueden llegar a un acuerdo sobre una soluci&amp;#243n por un juzgado, y algunas pueden abarcar m&amp;#225s de lo que un juez pudiera ordenar. En caso de discriminaci&amp;#243n en el empleo, se pueden ofrecer las siguientes indemnizaciones a trav&amp;#233s de los tribunales (dependiendo del asunto y del caso):</p>  <ul>  <li>Pago de indemnizaci&amp;#243n, pago inicial</li>  <li>Honorarios de los abogados</li>  <li>Da&amp;#241os compensatorios y punitivos</li>  <li>Recompensa por decisi&amp;#243n legal incluyendo la reincorporaci&amp;#243n al puesto, el ascenso, la transferencia, etc.</li>  <li>Publicaci&amp;#243n de anuncios</li>  </ul>  <p>Adem&amp;#225s, las siguientes soluciones generalmente no se refieren al litigio pero se pueden conseguir por medio de la mediaci&amp;#243n:</p>  <ul>  <li>Pagos fijos, anualidades</li>  <li>Confidencialidad</li>  <li>Servicios de ubicaci&amp;#243n de puestos externos</li>  <li>Programa de entrenamiento en el lugar de empleo</li>  <li>Disculpa</li>  <li>Revisi&amp;#243n de los expedientes laborales</li>  <li>Publicidad</li>  <li>Referencias para empleos</li>  <li>Planes de salud y otros beneficios adicionales</li>  <li>Opciones con acciones de la bolsa de valores</li>  <li>Donaciones de caridad</li>  <li>No exigir que se vuelva a aplicar o tener que ser contratado de nuevo en caso de infringirse el acuerdo</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Cu&amp;#225l es la diferencia de la mediaci&amp;#243n en temas relacionados a la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Todos los principios y ventajas b&amp;#225sicas de la mediaci&amp;#243n en general se pueden aplicar de igual manera a la mediaci&amp;#243n en la ADA. Sin embargo, existen varias consideraciones adicionales en la mediaci&amp;#243n sobre esta ley, empezando con asegurarse que a una persona con alguna discapacidad se le ofrezca cualquier acomodaci&amp;#243n necesaria para que &amp;#233l o ella pueda participar en la mediaci&amp;#243n. Algunas de las consideraciones que pueden presentarse en las mediaciones de la ADA ser&amp;#225n explicadas m&amp;#225s adelante.</p>  </div>  <h2>Mediaci&amp;#243n temprana en caso de no poder llegar a un acuerdo sobre temas relacionados a las acomodaciones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La Comisi&amp;#243n para la igualdad de Oportunidades en el Empleo (EEOC), es la encargada de hacer cumplir el T&amp;#237tulo I de la ADA, la Comisi&amp;#243n recomienda enf&amp;#225ticamente que las partes tengan un \"proceso interactivo\" al determinar si se requiere una acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable para permitirle a un empleado o a una persona que esta solicitando un puesto de trabajo llevar a cabo las funciones esenciales del cargo que se tiene o se est&amp;#225 buscando. Con frecuencia este proceso interactivo resulta en un acuerdo entre las partes sobre las acomodaciones m&amp;#225s efectivas, quiz&amp;#225s con la ayuda de un experto externo. En caso de que las partes no puedan llegar a un acuerdo, la mediaci&amp;#243n podr&amp;#237a ser el siguiente paso m&amp;#225s conveniente. Un especialista de planta en la resoluci&amp;#243n de conflictos o un miembro del departamento de recursos humanos con habilidades para la mediaci&amp;#243n puede ser ?til en facilitar el dialogo, ya sea informalmente o llevando a cabo una mediaci&amp;#243n completa entre la persona solicitando el puesto (o el empleado), y el representante del empleador responsable de tomar la decisi&amp;#243n acerca de la acomodaci&amp;#243n. Es posible que a veces sea necesario utilizar un experto externo si el especialista de planta no se considera suficientemente neutral.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Cu&amp;#225les son las nuevas directrices de mediaci&amp;#243n en temas de la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Recientemente el Grupo nacional de trabajo, compuesto de doce especialistas, entrenadores y administradores en el &amp;#225mbito nacional del campo de la mediaci&amp;#243n, se encargaron de desarrollar las directrices sobre la mediaci&amp;#243n en la ADA. Estas directrices han proporcionado valiosa informaci&amp;#243n y gu&amp;#237as con respecto a la mediaci&amp;#243n de casos relacionados a la ADA, que tambi&amp;#233n est&amp;#225n cubiertos por otros estatutos sobre derechos civiles como la Ley de Rehabilitaci&amp;#243n de 1973, las correcciones a la Ley para garantizar igualdad para el acceso a la vivienda de 1988, y las leyes comparables sobre los derechos civiles estatales y locales. Estas directrices tambi&amp;#233n pueden aplicarse en la mediaci&amp;#243n de casos no relacionados a la ADA, como desacuerdos comerciales o de familia relacionados a una persona discapacitada.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191C&amp;#243mo escojo un mediador en un caso relacionado a la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Debe escoger un mediador competente en la mediaci&amp;#243n del tipo de caso relacionado al lugar de trabajo en cuesti&amp;#243n. Estas directrices establecen que el mediador no s&amp;#243lo debe ser un experto en el proceso de la mediaci&amp;#243n, sino tambi&amp;#233n en el tema del conflicto. En general, los mediadores deben tener conocimientos sobre las discapacidades, el acceso a las personas discapacitadas, y la ley para Personas con discapacidades, incluyendo documentos sobre el desarrollo y las gu&amp;#237as de la jurisprudencia general de la ADA presentados por las agencias de regulaci&amp;#243n. Un mediador que es experto en t&amp;#233rminos de la condici&amp;#243n jur&amp;#237dica de la ley va a poder trabajar con las partes en forma efectiva explorando la magnitud de las opciones para llegar a un acuerdo. Tambi&amp;#233n sabr&amp;#225 si las partes est&amp;#225n tomando decisiones basadas en un buen juicio y si est&amp;#225n haciendo acuerdos que se pueden poner en pr&amp;#225ctica. Un mediador puede ser competente en cuanto a la mediaci&amp;#243n de casos relacionados a la ADA luego de un entrenamiento sobre la mediaci&amp;#243n en casos de la ADA, experiencia haciendo mediaci&amp;#243n con respecto a la ADA, conocimiento legal sobre la ADA, y alguna combinaci&amp;#243n de todos estos factores. Tenga en cuenta que los temas del T&amp;#237tulo I (empleo) son diferentes a los temas del T&amp;#237tulo III (acomodaciones p?blicas), y el mediador en particular puede ser lo suficientemente competente para llevar a cabo la mediaci&amp;#243n en casos que surjan bajo un s&amp;#243lo t&amp;#237tulo y no necesariamente ambos.</p>  </div>  <h2>Garantizando que las mediaciones sean accesibles</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Estas directrices especifican claramente que los que ofrecen la mediaci&amp;#243n tienen la obligaci&amp;#243n de garantizar que sus servicios sean accesibles a personas con discapacidades. Si el empleador esta llevando a cabo un programa interno de mediaci&amp;#243n, el empleador tambi&amp;#233n debe garantizar que la mediaci&amp;#243n sea accesible.</p>  <p>Las personas que ofrecen la mediaci&amp;#243n de la ADA deben asegurarse que todo aspecto de la mediaci&amp;#243n, desde las sesiones iniciales del entrenamiento hasta las sesiones de la mediaci&amp;#243n misma, sean accesibles a todas las personas con discapacidades, incluyendo cada una de las partes, y otros que est&amp;#225n participando en el proceso de la mediaci&amp;#243n como los voluntarios del personal, y los mediadores. En t&amp;#233rminos de estos objetivos, se debe utilizar la definici&amp;#243n de la discapacidad en su forma m&amp;#225s amplia, incluyendo las condiciones cr&amp;#243nicas, s&amp;#237ntomas ocasionales, y las discapacidades temporales. Esto esta de acuerdo con los principios sobre la mediaci&amp;#243n generalmente aceptados que estipulan que las partes deben poder participar completamente en este proceso. Los programas de mediaci&amp;#243n deben incluir un proceso que permite que las personas puedan pedir acomodaciones si las necesitan. El mediador debe ser informado sobre cualquier acomodaci&amp;#243n por discapacidad requerida. En t&amp;#233rminos simples, para garantizar que la mediaci&amp;#243n sea exitosa, todas las partes tienen que estar presentes. Si una de las partes no puede estar presente debido a que no se les ofreci&amp;#243 una acomodaci&amp;#243n requerida, no es muy probable que la mediaci&amp;#243n se lleve a cabo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Asuntos sobre capacidad</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La gran mayor&amp;#237a de mediaciones sobre la ADA relacionadas al empleo no van a enfatizar el tema de la capacidad de cada una de las partes. En caso que el tema de la capacidad pueda ser relevante, las directrices han determinado que los mediadores deben aclarar quienes son las partes y si ambas partes entienden la naturaleza del proceso de la mediaci&amp;#243n, el papel del mediador, la relaci&amp;#243n de las partes con el mediador, y los asuntos en cuesti&amp;#243n. El mediador puede determinar si las partes pueden evaluar las diferentes opciones, llevar a cabo y mantener un acuerdo.</p>  <p>En caso de que una de las partes parezca tener una limitaci&amp;#243n en su capacidad, o est&amp;#225 capacidad no es muy clara, el mediador deber&amp;#225 determinar si una acomodaci&amp;#243n podr&amp;#237a permitirle a la parte su participaci&amp;#243n en una forma efectiva. Si esto no es posible, el mediador debe determinar si la persona podr&amp;#237a recibir servicios de mediaci&amp;#243n con el apoyo de otra persona, como un abogado presente u otra persona que lo apoyar&amp;#237a. Si a?n con el apoyo de otra persona la parte no tiene la capacidad de participar en la mediaci&amp;#243n, esta no puede continuar a menos que una tercera persona designada participe en el proceso representando los intereses de esa parte y tomando decisiones en su nombre.</p>  <p>Las directrices estipulan que el asunto de quien podr&amp;#237a actuar como persona designada es definida por la ley estatal, y podr&amp;#237an incluir representantes con poder de notario, personas con tutela, o miembros de la familia.</p>  <p>Las directrices enfatizan que el fallo de incapacidad \"legal\" no necesariamente determina la capacidad con respecto a la mediaci&amp;#243n, dependiendo de cuales asuntos est&amp;#225n siendo mediados. Por ejemplo, una persona puede tener un tutor para asuntos econ&amp;#243micos, pero no para tomar decisiones personales o sobre su estado de salud. La persona puede participar en la mediaci&amp;#243n sobre un tratamiento m&amp;#233dico de &amp;#233l o ella, pero tendr&amp;#237a que ser representado por un tutor en una mediaci&amp;#243n sobre asuntos econ&amp;#243micos. Un acuerdo firmado por una persona sin capacidad legal puede requerir que una persona designada tambi&amp;#233n tenga que firmarlo para asegurar que se pueda poner en pr&amp;#225ctica.</p>  </div>  <h2>&amp;#191Qui&amp;#233n estar&amp;#225 presente en la mediaci&amp;#243n de la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Como en cualquier mediaci&amp;#243n, las dos partes van a estar presentes. Una de las partes es una corporaci&amp;#243n o una organizaci&amp;#243n grande, y puede estar representada por m&amp;#225s de una persona, incluyendo los administradores, representantes del departamento de recursos humanos, o los abogados. Una persona con la autoridad para llegar a un acuerdo deber&amp;#225 estar presente.</p>  <p>Las directrices han tomado la posici&amp;#243n que cada una de las partes puede traer su propio representante a la sesi&amp;#243n de mediaci&amp;#243n. El representante puede ser una persona que aboga sobre los derechos por discapacidad, un experto, un consejero de rehabilitaci&amp;#243n vocacional, un entrenador en el lugar de trabajo, un miembro de la familia, un abogado, un representante del sindicato, u otra persona. El representante puede aconsejar y hacer presentaciones en nombre de la persona, pero no es igual a la persona designada, ya que no puede decidir por la persona. Una parte puede tener presente a una persona quien lo apoye, sirviendo tambi&amp;#233n como su representante, o adem&amp;#225s de su representante, puede tener otra persona para ayudarlo, como por ejemplo alguien que le d&amp;#233 apoyo emocional.</p>  <p>Las personas discapacitadas pueden traer a sus ayudantes personales (AP) quienes est&amp;#225n bajo su supervisi&amp;#243n y quienes les proveen asistencia f&amp;#237sica o de otro tipo. Un int&amp;#233rprete calificado en el lenguaje de se&amp;#241as u oral tiene una doble funci&amp;#243n, como una \"acomodaci&amp;#243n por discapacidad\" en el caso de personas con limitaciones auditivas o que tienen discapacidades del habla, y la de facilitar la comunicaci&amp;#243n entre estas personas y otras en la sesi&amp;#243n.</p>  <p>Adem&amp;#225s, las partes pueden contratar expertos, o el mediador, con el permiso de las partes, puede invitar a un experto neutral para educarlo y a las otros partes sobre la discapacidad, y para ayudar a desarrollar diferentes opciones. El mediador tambi&amp;#233n deber&amp;#225 determinar si las partes han considerado la posibilidad de un acuerdo relacionado a las partes no presentes, como otros empleados o el sindicato laboral y sus miembros. El impacto del acuerdo sobre las otras partes puede afectar la forma en que tal acuerdo se va a poner en pr&amp;#225ctica, su implementaci&amp;#243n efectiva, y la duraci&amp;#243n del mismo.</p>  </div>  <p>Como en cualquier mediaci&amp;#243n, las dos partes van a estar presentes. Una de las partes es una corporaci&amp;#243n o una organizaci&amp;#243n grande, y puede estar representada por m&amp;#225s de una persona, incluyendo los administradores, representantes del departamento de recursos humanos, o los abogados. Una persona con la autoridad para llegar a un acuerdo deber&amp;#225 estar presente.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>En casos relacionados al T&amp;#237tulo I de la ADA donde la acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable es un asunto en cuesti&amp;#243n, la sesi&amp;#243n conjunta le ofrece a las partes la oportunidad de continuar en el \"proceso interactivo\" (favorecido por la EEOC, los tribunales, y los comentaristas) para identificar o evaluar las acomodaciones alternativas. Generalmente, se tratar&amp;#225 de tener el proceso interactivo antes de la mediaci&amp;#243n del conflicto con respecto a la acomodaci&amp;#243n razonable. Las directrices de mediaci&amp;#243n de la ADA denotan que cuando el proceso interactivo esta siendo utilizado en el contexto de una mediaci&amp;#243n, debe aclararse que cualquier medida expresada o llevada a cabo, a?n como parte del proceso interactivo, se mantendr&amp;#225 confidencial y no se podr&amp;#225 admitir como prueba en ning?n proceso legal, a menos que las partes lo hubieran acordado de otra manera.</p>  </div>  <h2>Confidencialidad</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Consistente con las obligaciones generales de la confidencialidad, las directrices estipulan que los mediadores deber&amp;#225n mantener la confidencialidad de la informaci&amp;#243n relacionada a la discapacidad al tomar medidas sobre el acceso a la mediaci&amp;#243n, y al llevarla a cabo. A?n cuando la persona (&amp;#233l o ella), con la discapacidad haya identificado su discapacidad especifica puede haber informaci&amp;#243n que esta persona no quiere que se revele, como el diagn&amp;#243stico o la severidad de su problema de salud. En caso que un mediador considere que ser&amp;#237a ?til para la mediaci&amp;#243n compartir esta informaci&amp;#243n, el mediador deber&amp;#225 primero reunirse en privado con la persona discapacitada para hablar sobre si esta persona quiere que la informaci&amp;#243n sea compartida, pero el mediador no puede compartirla sin su permiso.</p>  </div>  <h2>Informaci&amp;#243n legal y consejos legales</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Como es evidente en cualquier mediaci&amp;#243n donde los derechos civiles est&amp;#225n en cuesti&amp;#243n, los mediadores deben asegurarse que las partes est&amp;#233n conscientes de sus derechos legales y de sus responsabilidades con respecto a la ADA antes de iniciar la mediaci&amp;#243n, para que las partes puedan participar completamente y puedan tomar decisiones informadas. Aunque los materiales educativos como los folletos de la ADA pueden ser ?tiles, estos no pueden reemplazar el consejo y la representaci&amp;#243n legal.</p>  <p>Las directrices denotan que previa a la sesi&amp;#243n de mediaci&amp;#243n y previa al inicio de cada sesi&amp;#243n se le debe aconsejar a las partes sobre su derecho a obtener representaci&amp;#243n legal o de otro tipo. Las partes en una mediaci&amp;#243n sobre la ADA deber&amp;#225n ser aconsejadas sobre los riesgos de no tener la representaci&amp;#243n de un abogado, o de no tener a un abogado que revise un posible acuerdo.</p>  <p>El mediador puede referir a las partes a recursos donde puede obtener esta representaci&amp;#243n. En caso que el mediador considere que una de las partes no entienda las implicaciones de un posible acuerdo, el mediador debe de tratar que esta parte consulte con fuentes de informaci&amp;#243n y consejos apropiados.</p>  </div>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,2,'Sheila D.

Mientras que, generalmente, el uso de las drogas y el alcohol no aumentan al nivel de constituirse en una discapacidad, el abuso y dependencia, s&iacute;. El abuso de las drogas y el alcohol se caracteriza por su uso intenso, regular, espor&aacute;dicamente fuerte o exagerado; la dependencia se caracteriza por su uso compulsivo o adictivo.</p>  <p>Los dos manuales de diagn&oacute;stico est&aacute;ndar de medicina, el Manual IV de Diagn&oacute;stico y Estad&iacute;stica (DSM-IV) y las Estad&iacute;sticas de Clasificaci&oacute;n Internacional de Enfermedades, Lesiones y Causas de Muerte (ICD-10), clasifican el abuso y dependencia de drogas y alcohol como enfermedades tratables. Estos manuales tambi&eacute;n proveen los criterios para diagnosticar abuso y dependencia de droga y alcohol enfoc&aacute;ndose en los s&iacute;ntomas psicol&oacute;gicos, cognitivos y de conducta. El impacto que causa el uso de la droga y el alcohol en el funcionamiento ocupacional y social es un factor importante al evaluar la severidad con que afecta la condici&oacute;n de un individuo. Muchos individuos con problemas de drogas y alcohol pueden continuar trabajando a&uacute;n mucho tiempo despu&eacute;s de que el uso de drogas y alcohol ya ha empezado a afectar sus funciones sociales y familiares. Sin embargo, se puede apreciar su impacto en la fuerza laboral americana. La p&eacute;rdida de productividad y salarios, m&aacute;s gastos relacionados con lesiones, le cuesta a la fuerza laboral americana m&aacute;s de 100 billones de d&oacute;lares por a&ntilde;o.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; Protecci&oacute;n Contra la Discriminaci&oacute;n se Provee a Individuos con discapacidades relacionada al uso de Droga y Alcohol?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Muchos empleadores desconocen que la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades, (ADA), protege a los individuos que tienen problemas de drogas y alcohol en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n en el empleo. Esta confusi&oacute;n se debe a que la ADA incluye las dos cosas, protecci&oacute;n del empleo y sanciones con respecto a individuos con problemas actuales de drogas y alcohol.</p>  <p>Personas que han tenido problemas con la droga y el alcohol son protegidos en contra de discriminaci&oacute;n en el trabajo por la ADA, al igual que las personas que tienen problemas actuales pero que pueden desempe&ntilde;arse en sus trabajos. Los individuos que contin&uacute;an usando drogas ilegalmente o abusando del alcohol, no tienen los mismos derechos que otras personas con discapacidades.</p>  <p>Si la empresa decide actuar en contra de esta persona que usa drogas ilegalmente, la ADA espec&iacute;ficamente excluye de la definici&oacute;n de,&ldquo;individuo con una discapacidad&rdquo;, a cualquier empleado o aspirante que est&eacute; envuelto ilegalmente en el uso de drogas. Esto incluye a todo individuo que usa prescripciones m&eacute;dicas ilegalmente. Los individuos que usan drogas bajo la supervisi&oacute;n de un profesional de la salud &ndash; tales como metadona- no est&aacute;n usando drogas ilegalmente y por lo tanto est&aacute;n protegidos en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n. En a&ntilde;os recientes ha habido un auge en crear drogas que ayuden a individuos en su recuperaci&oacute;n y consecuentemente es muy factible que personas que han usado drogas entren a un trabajo con medicina recetada con el fin de ayudarlos a conservarse sobrios.</p>  <p>Aunque los individuos que ilegalmente siguen usando drogas no est&aacute;n protegidos, la ADA protege espec&iacute;ficamente a individuos que est&eacute;n participando en un programa supervisado de rehabilitaci&oacute;n, han completado un programa de tratamiento, o fueron rehabilitados a trav&eacute;s de grupos de apoyo mutuo o por medio de programas de asistencia al empleado o cualquier otro tipo de rehabilitaci&oacute;n y que ya no usan drogas.</p>  <p>Adicionalmente, la ADA protege a los individuos que err&oacute;neamente fueron acusados de usar drogas il&iacute;citas. A causa de la actitud de la sociedad acerca del abuso de drogas, muchos individuos que han tenido problemas de drogas en el pasado, son percibidos como si todav&iacute;a fueran dependientes de las drogas. Asimismo, individuos que reciben metadona en programas de apoyo son frecuentemente percibidos como dependientes de las drogas, aunque que la metadona es una medicaci&oacute;n que se prescribe legalmente y los individuos que participan en estos programas pueden hacer cualquier labor &ndash; incluso labores peligrosas &ndash; que una persona que no est&aacute; en este tratamiento. Bajo los estatutos de la ADA, estos individuos est&aacute;n protegidos en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Los programas de pruebas de droga en el trabajo han producido tambi&eacute;n un sinn&uacute;mero de individuos con la posibilidad de que hayan sido acusados err&oacute;neamente como dependientes de las drogas cuando, en realidad, no lo son. Invariablemente, las pruebas de drogas pueden equivocadamente identificar a individuos como drogadictos. Esto puede ocurrir porque la prueba se haya hecho incorrectamente, porque se haya identificado incorrectamente una sustancia en su organismo como droga, o porque una prescripci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica haya sido incorrectamente identificada como droga il&iacute;cita. La ADA proh&iacute;be la discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de individuos que han sido err&oacute;neamente percibidos como adictos a sustancias controladas, sin serlo, s&oacute;lo porque una prueba de drogas, falsamente, sali&oacute; positiva. Sin embargo la ADA no protege la discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de individuos que err&oacute;neamente han sido vistos como que usan drogas por placer espor&aacute;dicamente, porque el empleador no considera a este individuo como alguien con una discapacidad considerablemente limitante. Esta es un &aacute;rea muy compleja y sensitiva ya que muchos empleadores utilizan p&oacute;lizas para las pruebas de drogas que se&ntilde;alan los pasos espec&iacute;ficos a seguir cuando se encuentra un caso positivo de droga.</p>  <p>Los individuos que tienen discapacidades que les limita considerablemente en una o m&aacute;s de sus tareas cotidianas, est&aacute;n protegidos en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n al igual que cualquier otro individuo con una discapacidad. Bajo los estatutos de la ADA, el alcohol no es considerado como una &ldquo;droga&rdquo; y, por lo tanto, el abuso actual del alcohol no excluye a nadie de la protecci&oacute;n de la ADA. Sin embargo, <em>los individuos con discapacidades actuales por el alcohol, al igual que cualquier otro individuo con una limitaci&oacute;n actual, deber&aacute;n de poder llevar a cabo las funciones esenciales de su trabajo para as&iacute; estar protegidos en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n.</em> Adem&aacute;s, la ADA le permite espec&iacute;ficamente a un empleador que exija, de los empleados que abusan el alcohol, el mismo rendimiento y est&aacute;ndares de conducta que se aplican a todos los empleados, aun cuando los problemas de ese empleado sean relacionados por el abuso del alcohol.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es el uso &ldquo;actual&rdquo; de drogas ilegales?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La definici&oacute;n de una persona que &ldquo;actualmente est&aacute; usando drogas il&iacute;citas&rdquo; no est&aacute; limitada a la persona que hace uso de drogas il&iacute;citas en el d&iacute;a o en las semanas previas al empleo donde se lleva la acci&oacute;n en cuesti&oacute;n. De preferencia, el empleador deber&aacute; de tomar una determinaci&oacute;n individual enfoc&aacute;ndose en si el individuo ha usado la droga muy cerca al d&iacute;a de haberse llevado la acci&oacute;n en el empleo lo cual indique que hay un problema real y actual. Si un individuo tuvo una prueba positiva de uso de drogas il&iacute;citas y el resultado indica correctamente el uso ilegal de una sustancia controlada bajo los estatutos de la ADA, esta persona ser&aacute; considerada como alguien que actualmente usa droga.</p>  <p>La Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidades en el Empleo de los EE.UU., declara que el uso casual de drogas no es una discapacidad de acuerdo con los estatutos de la ADA. Tener un discapacidad de acuerdo con la ley, es aquellos individuos que son adictos a las drogas, los que tienen un historial de adicci&oacute;n, o los que han sido considerados como que son adictos. Para que el uso de drogas de un individuo sea considerado como discapacidad bajo los estatutos de la ADA, tiene que presentar una limitaci&oacute;n considerable en una o m&aacute;s de sus actividades cotidianas. Adicionalmente, el individuo no puede estar actualmente usando drogas il&iacute;citas. El negarle el empleo a alguien que lo solicita s&oacute;lo porque tiene un historial de usar drogas ocasionalmente no causar&aacute; sospechas a la ADA. Por otra parte, las pol&iacute;ticas que dejan fuera a aspirantes, debido a un historial de adicci&oacute;n o tratamiento por adicci&oacute;n, deber&aacute;n ser escudri&ntilde;adas cuidadosamente para asegurarse de que las pol&iacute;ticas son relativas al trabajo y consistentes con la necesidad de la empresa. Si se asegura que estas pol&iacute;ticas son usadas como justificaci&oacute;n para la seguridad de la empresa, entonces el empleador deber&aacute; demostrar que los individuos excluidos debido a su historial de adicci&oacute;n o tratamiento de droga plantear&iacute;an una amenaza directa -- es decir, un riesgo significativo de da&ntilde;o substancial -- a la salud o a la seguridad de otras o, quiz&aacute;s, a si mismos y que esta amenaza no se puede eliminar o reducir a trav&eacute;s de acomodamientos razonables. Una vez m&aacute;s, a los individuos que actualmente utilizan drogas ilegales, incluso a los que son adictos, se les puede negar el empleo a causa de su uso actual de drogas.</p>  <p>Debido a que la ADA protege a individuos que est&aacute;n participando en programas de rehabilitaci&oacute;n y a aquellos que est&aacute;n rehabilitados (siempre y cuando no est&eacute;n actualmente usando drogas il&iacute;citas), los empleadores deber&aacute;n tener cuidado al intentar usar el pasado de un individuo, por haber usado drogas antes de someterse en un tratamiento, para tomar acciones adversas en contra de ellos.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; preguntas y pruebas m&eacute;dicas son permitidas para determinar si un individuo tiene problemas de drogas o alcohol?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El campo de oportunidad y de tiempo para hacer preguntas y pruebas relacionadas al uso de drogas y alcohol depender&aacute; en el tipo de informaci&oacute;n que espera conseguirse. Un empleador puede preguntar legalmente a sus empleados y aspirantes si usan drogas en la actualidad, antes o despu&eacute;s de haberles ofrecido el trabajo y mientras trabajen para &eacute;l sin violar con eso los estatutos de la ADA, porque un individuo que actualmente usa drogas no est&aacute; protegido por la ADA. La ADA, dicta espec&iacute;ficamente, que las pruebas para determinar si en la actualidad se est&aacute; usando substancias controladas ilegalmente no son consideradas ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos.</p>  <p>Un empleador puede tambi&eacute;n, durante la fase de preofrecimiento del trabajo, cuestionar acerca del uso de drogas ilegales en el pasado, siempre y cuando no exista la probabilidad de que sus preguntas inciten a revelar informaci&oacute;n acerca de una discapacidad. Preguntas tales como &ldquo;&iquest;ha usado drogas il&iacute;citas alguna vez? o, &ldquo;&iquest;cu&aacute;ndo fue la &uacute;ltima vez que us&oacute; drogas il&iacute;citas? son preguntas aceptables. Preguntas relacionadas con adicci&oacute;n no son permitidas durante la entrevista, pero pueden ser preguntadas despu&eacute;s de que se ha extendido una oferta de trabajo o al momento de otorgarse el trabajo, siempre y cuando las preguntas sean relativas al trabajo y consistentes con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  <p>En general, preguntas acerca del uso legal de drogas no son permitidas durante la entrevista porque es muy probable que susciten informaci&oacute;n sobre la discapacidad de la persona. Sin embargo, si la persona resulta positiva en la prueba de drogas, el empleador puede preguntar si tal vez los resultados positivos de la prueba se deban al uso de drogas legales.</p>  <p>Cuando un empleador obtiene informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica en la etapa de la entrevista, deber&aacute; tener cuidado de no usar la informaci&oacute;n en una forma que infrinja los estatutos de la ADA. Para evitar la posibilidad de este tipo de alegaciones, muchos empleadores prefieren conducir pruebas de drogas despu&eacute;s de haber hecho un ofrecimiento condicional de trabajo. En todos los casos en los cuales un empleador obtiene informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica por medio de un cuestionamiento o de una prueba, la informaci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica deber&aacute; ser recogida y guardada en formularios y archivos separados y deber&aacute; ser tratada como un archivo m&eacute;dico confidencial.</p>  <p>Un empleador puede indagar acerca de los h&aacute;bitos de tomar durante la etapa de la entrevista, y hacer preguntas como, si la persona toma o ha sido arrestado alguna vez por manejar intoxicado, siempre y cuando no exista la posibilidad de que las preguntas inciten a revelar informaci&oacute;n acerca de problemas de alcoholismo. En contraste, el preguntar cuanto toma una persona o si alguna vez ha participado en un programa de rehabilitaci&oacute;n para alcoh&oacute;licos no es aceptable, porque es probable que recojan informaci&oacute;n sobre problemas de alcoholismo. Las pruebas de alcohol no pueden ser suministradas antes de un ofrecimiento de trabajo porque son consideradas pruebas m&eacute;dicas. Preguntas sobre alcoholismo o pruebas de alcohol pueden ser hechas despu&eacute;s de la entrevista o al momento de otorgarse el trabajo, siempre y cuando las preguntas sean relativas al trabajo y consistentes con las necesidades de la empresa.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; puede hacer un empleador para asegurarse que un individuo ya no est&aacute; usando drogas?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La ADA le permite a los empleadores tomar medidas razonables para asegurarse que un individuo ya no est&aacute; usando drogas il&iacute;citas. Los empleadores tienen permiso de conducir pruebas de droga y de obtener informaci&oacute;n de los programas de tratamiento de forma que puedan observar si el uso de drogas contin&uacute;a. Si un empleador tiene un programa de asistencia para el empleado (EAP), la EAP puede ser la mejor entidad para reportar cambios.</p>  <p>A la vez que la ADA no impone muchas restricciones en pruebas de droga, s&iacute; requiere que los empleadores usen procedimientos confiables en las pruebas y que cumplan con cualquier ley local, estatal o federal que regule las pruebas de drogas.</p>  <p>Adem&aacute;s, al buscar informaci&oacute;n sobre la rehabilitaci&oacute;n de un individuo en los programas de tratamiento de drogas o alcohol, los empleadores deben de tomar en cuenta que hay regulaciones federales que rigen casi todos los programas de rehabilitaci&oacute;n sobre el hacer p&uacute;blica cualquier informaci&oacute;n de los pacientes en programas de rehabilitaci&oacute;n de drogas y alcohol.<sup>1</sup> Estas regulaciones, existen con el fin de proteger la confidencialidad de individuos con problemas de drogas y alcohol, requieren el cumplimiento de una forma detallada de consentimiento antes de que los empleadores puedan recibir informaci&oacute;n sobre cualquier tratamiento y pone estrictas limitaciones en como los empleadores pueden usar, guardar, y hacer p&uacute;blica esa informaci&oacute;n. Estas regulaciones, que imponen est&aacute;ndares m&aacute;s rigurosos en la confidencialidad del individuo que la ADA, reemplazan los requisitos que tiene la ADA para la protecci&oacute;n de informaci&oacute;n de tratamientos de drogas y alcohol.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup> Confidencialidad de los Archivos de Pacientes que han Abusado de la Droga y el Alcohol, 42 C.F.R. Parte 2</div>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; acomodaciones necesitan los individuos con problemas de drogas y alcohol?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las acomodaciones, que individuos en proceso de recuperaci&oacute;n por problemas de drogas o alcohol necesitan, var&iacute;an dependiendo en los requisitos de sus trabajos y el tiempo que necesitan para su recuperaci&oacute;n. Por ejemplo, los individuos que recientemente han completado un programa de rehabilitaci&oacute;n puede que necesiten participar regularmente en un programa estructurado de cuidado continuo a pacientes no internados. Otros que se han mantenido sobrios por mucho tiempo pueden participar en grupos de ayuda mutua, tales como grupos de Alcoh&oacute;licos An&oacute;nimos, para as&iacute; prevenir relapsos. La participaci&oacute;n en estos programas de cuidado continuo puede requerir alg&uacute;n tipo de acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Ejemplos de posibles acomodaciones incluyen:</p>  <ul>  <li>La estructuraci&oacute;n del d&iacute;a de trabajo para que se requiera menos tareas exigentes cuando ocurra la fatiga.</li>  <li>El ajustar los m&eacute;todos de supervisi&oacute;n, o sea, comunicando asignaciones o instrucciones por escrito o por correo electr&oacute;nico en vez de en forma oral o, proporcionando una estructura o instrucciones m&aacute;s detalladas.</li>  <li>Un horario modificado de trabajo que le permita al empleado recoger su dosis diaria de metadona o atender sesiones de consejer&iacute;a para prevenci&oacute;n de relapsos para pacientes no internados.</li>  <li>Una reestructuraci&oacute;n del trabajo para aminorar tareas que puedan comprometer su recuperaci&oacute;n o situaciones &ldquo;riesgosas&rdquo;, o sea, oportunidades de socializar con clientes u otros empleados que tienen fama de tomadores.</li>  <li>La reasignaci&oacute;n temporal a un empleado de una posici&oacute;n peligrosa a otra de menos peligro mientras que &eacute;l o ella completan su tratamiento.</li>  <li>La reasignaci&oacute;n a una posici&oacute;n vacante equivalente a la suya si el supervisor actual est&aacute; demasiado ocupado supervisando a otros empleados o sirviendo al p&uacute;blico proporcion&aacute;ndoles direcciones o arreglos necesarios.</li>  </ul>  <p>Adem&aacute;s, y porque los individuos con discapacidades por el uso del alcohol est&aacute;n protegidos en contra de discriminaci&oacute;n en tanto puedan hacer sus tareas con eficacia y con seguridad, se requiere que los empleadores provean un permiso sin paga que le permita a un individuo con discapacidad por el uso del alcohol internarse en un programa de tratamiento de alcoholismo. Adem&aacute;s, si un empleador proporciona un permiso pagado a individuos que est&aacute;n bajo tratamiento m&eacute;dico por discapacidad, el empleador debe de proveer los mismos beneficios a un individuo que est&eacute; bajo un tratamiento por alcoholismo.</p>  <p>Es importante recordar que algunos empleados no necesitar&aacute;n ninguna acomodaci&oacute;n, sino un cambio en la forma de pensar respecto a lo que puede hacer un individuo que ha estado discapacitado por confrontar en el pasado problemas con las drogas o el alcohol. Las personas en proceso de recuperaci&oacute;n pueden realizar todos los trabajos con seguridad, incluyendo trabajos peligrosos, y no representan un riesgo para otros solamente porque tienen un pasado de adici&oacute;n de drogas o alcohol. La obligaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s importante de un empleador, de acuerdo con la ADA, es evaluar la capacidad que tiene cada individuo para desarrollar las tareas esenciales del trabajo y tomar decisiones del empleo basado en la capacidad del individuo y su funcionamiento en el trabajo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo afectan otras leyes federales, relativas al uso de la droga y el alcohol, los est&aacute;ndares de la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La ADA permite a los empleadores cumplir con otras leyes y regulaciones federales relativas al uso de drogas y alcohol. Dentro de estos est&aacute;ndares federales se incluyen La Ley del Trabajo Libre de Drogas y los est&aacute;ndares establecidos por El Departamento de Transportaci&oacute;n, El Departamento de Defensa y la Comisi&oacute;n de Regulaciones Nucleares, estos est&aacute;ndares permiten poner pruebas de uso de drogas, y en algunos casos de alcohol, a un empleado por razones de protecci&oacute;n y seguridad. Los est&aacute;ndares establecidos por estas leyes y reglas federales son consistentes con los estatutos de la ADA y, en su mayor&iacute;a, no imponen m&aacute;s restricciones en los derechos de los individuos en labores peligrosas y de seguridad.</p>  <p>Las regulaciones en las pruebas de droga, en particular, cubren un n&uacute;mero limitado de empleados cuales tareas directamente afectan la seguridad de otros. Estas regulaciones, requieren que los empleados cumplan con restricciones del consumo de drogas y alcohol cuando no est&aacute;n trabajando e impide a los individuos que violen estas reglas en obtener un trabajo sensitivo y con riesgos. Dichas regulaciones, tambi&eacute;n, dan a los empleadores el derecho de determinar, cuando un individuo ha resultado positivo por droga &oacute; alcohol, si un empleado puede regresar a trabajar en una posici&oacute;n sensitiva y con riesgos.</p>  <p>Aparte de esos est&aacute;ndares, la ADA no permite que los empleadores traten a los individuos que han estado discapacitado por confrontar en el pasado problemas con las drogas o el alcohol, y que tengan labores relacionadas con la seguridad, diferente a otros empleados.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recursos</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n acerca de la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades y acomodaciones razonables, favor de contactar las siguientes organizaciones:</p>  <p><strong>L&iacute;nea abierta del Centro Regional de Asesor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica en Discapacidad e Industria de la ADA&mdash;</strong><br /> (800) 949-4232 (Voz/TTY)</p>  <p><strong>Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo de los Estados Unidos</strong><br /> 1801 Calle L, NW, Washington, DC 20507,<br /> Asistencia T&eacute;cnica, (800) 669-4000, (Voz) (TTY) (800) 800-3302<br /> Si quiere ordenar alguna publicaci&oacute;n llamar al:<br /> 1-800-666-3362 (Voz)/ 800-800-3302 (TTY)</p>  <p>Tambi&eacute;n hay otras organizaciones que pueden proveerle informaci&oacute;n acerca de problemas con la droga y el alcohol y que asisten a individuos con este tipo de problemas.

INSERT INTO `brochures` VALUES (68,'Diabetes','Consideraciones de Empleo para Personas con Diabetes',4,'<h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es la Diabetes?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La diabetes es una enfermedad con la cual el cuerpo no produce o usa apropiadamente la insulina. La insulina es una hormona que se necesita para convertir el az&uacute;car, la f&eacute;cula y otros alimentos en energ&iacute;a muy necesaria para la diario vivir. Aproximadamente existen 16 millones de personas con diabetes en los Estados Unidos.</p>  <p>Hay dos tipos principales de diabetes:</p>  <p><strong>La diabetes tipo 1</strong> (conocido anteriormente como &ldquo;diabetes juvenil&rdquo; o &ldquo;diabetes dependiente-de-insulina&rdquo;) &ndash; es una enfermedad por la cual el cuerpo no produce nada de insulina, diagnosticada primero y con m&aacute;s frecuencia en ni&ntilde;os y j&oacute;venes adultos. Las personas con diabetes 1 deben de inyectarse diariamente de insulina o usar una bomba de insulina para mantenerse con vida. La diabetes tipo 1, se cuenta entre un 5 a un 10 por ciento de los casos de diabetes.</p>  <p><strong>La diabetes tipo 2</strong> (conocida anteriormente como &ldquo;diabetes inicial de adultos&rdquo;) &ndash; es un desorden metab&oacute;lico que resulta de la inhabilidad del cuerpo de producir suficiente, o usar apropiadamente, la insulina. Esta es la forma m&aacute;s com&uacute;n de la enfermedad. La diabetes tipo 2 se cuenta entre un 90 a un 95 por ciento de los casos de diabetes. Las personas con diabetes tipo 2 tratan de controlar la enfermedad por medio de control del peso, una dieta apropiada, ejercicio, medicaci&oacute;n oral, y/o insulina, dependiendo del curso que ha tomado la enfermedad en la persona. Cerca de la mitad de las personas diagnosticadas con diabetes tipo 2 toman insulina.</p>  <p>La diabetes hace que los niveles de glucosa (az&uacute;car) en la sangre aumenten. Esto es conocido como hiperglucemia. En poco tiempo, los niveles altos de la glucosa en la sangre pueden causar hambre, sed, dolor de cabeza, visi&oacute;n borrosa, orinar con frecuencia, comez&oacute;n y resequedad de la piel, y &ndash; la posible consecuencia m&aacute;s seria a corto plazo &ndash; cetoacidosis diab&eacute;tica, o &ldquo;coma diab&eacute;tica&rdquo;, que puede causar problemas respiratorios, estado de coma e incluso la muerte.</p>  <p>En un plazo largo, los niveles altos de glucosa en la sangre pueden causar un gran n&uacute;mero de complicaciones serias tales como enfermedades de los ojos (incluyendo la ceguera), enfermedades del ri&ntilde;&oacute;n, (incluyendo la falla del ri&ntilde;&oacute;n), da&ntilde;os en los nervios, enfermedades del vaso sangu&iacute;neo (incluyendo ataques al coraz&oacute;n, derrame cerebral y amputaciones del pie o pierna), y susceptibilidad a infecciones peligrosas.</p>  <p>La insulina y medicamentos de v&iacute;a oral no curan la diabetes. Por otra parte, la insulina y algunos medicamentos orales pueden hacer que los niveles de glucosa en la sangre bajen demasiado. A esto se le conoce como hipoglucemia y puede resultar en temblores, palpitaciones y sudor, confusi&oacute;n, mareos, cambios de humor, insensibilidad, inconsciencia y muerte.</p>  <p>Esto no significa que la mayor&iacute;a de las personas con diabetes, o a&uacute;n diab&eacute;ticos tratados-con-insulina, experimentar&aacute;n los extremos m&aacute;s severos de niveles altos y bajos de az&uacute;car en la sangre. Significa que las personas con diabetes deben de mantenerse vigilantes para as&iacute; poder mantener sus niveles de az&uacute;car en la sangre lo m&aacute;s cerca posible del nivel normal para evitar una amplia gama de problemas m&eacute;dicos inmediatos y a largo plazo.</p>  <p>Un tanto como cinco de los diecis&eacute;is millones de estadounidenses con diabetes no saben que tienen esta condici&oacute;n. Esto es peligroso porque estas personas est&aacute;n expuestas a las consecuencias a plazo corto y largo de niveles altos de glucosa en la sangre. Los empleadores pueden ofrecer programas de educaci&oacute;n y detecci&oacute;n de la diabetes. Esto puede causar que los empleados est&eacute;n m&aacute;s alertas a los s&iacute;ntomas de la diabetes y puede animarlos a hacerse pruebas y as&iacute; poder obtener un tratamiento adecuado.</p>  <p>La diabetes no puede ser curada pero, las personas con diabetes a trav&eacute;s de auto-cuidados, pueden adaptar la comida, insulina y/o medicaci&oacute;n oral, y ejercicio para as&iacute; poder mantener los niveles de glucosa en la sangre dentro de una l&iacute;nea prescrita. La persona con diabetes necesita hacerse responsable de mantener una dieta apropiada, hacer ejercicio, y procurar el cuidado m&eacute;dico apropiado. Las personas que tienen un buen cuidado de si mismos pueden ser tan productivos, e incluso m&aacute;s que los otros empleados, simplemente porque ellos est&aacute;n bien informados acerca de, y participan en, un estilo de vida saludable.</p>  </div>  <h2>La Diabetes y la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades (ADA)</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La ley ADA define a la persona con una discapacidad en tres formas:</p>  <ol>  <li>Un individuo que tiene una discapacidad f&iacute;sica o mental que limita substancialmente sus labores cotidianas;</li>  <li>Alguien que tiene un historial de una discapacidad o;</li>  <li>Alguien que es considerado como que tiene una discapacidad</li>  </ol>  <p>La diabetes no es muy conocida o entendida por muchos empleadores. La gran mayor&iacute;a de personas con diabetes viven y trabajan sucesivamente sin que la enfermedad cause un impacto negativo en su trabajo. Porque su condici&oacute;n no afecta su habilidad para hacer sus labores, ellos pueden decidir no informar a su empleador de su condici&oacute;n. El miedo a la discriminaci&oacute;n hace que muchos empleados con diabetes se mantengan callados.</p>  <p><em>&iquest;En qu&eacute; &aacute;reas puede un empleador discriminar? </em><br /> Al igual que con cualquier otra discapacidad, la posibilidad de discriminaci&oacute;n est&aacute; latente en cualquier punto del proceso de empleo.</p>  <p>Ejemplos:</p>  <ul>  <li>Una enfermera mand&oacute; su curr&iacute;culum v&iacute;tae a 16 instituciones y en su carta de presentaci&oacute;n menciona que tiene diabetes. Solamente dos de ellas contestaron y ning&uacute;n ofrecimiento de trabajo.</li>  <li>Un hombre con diabetes, contratado inicialmente para correr una boutique a bordo de un barco, fue rechazado por el doctor de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a porque un pasajero con diabetes cay&oacute; en coma hace 20 a&ntilde;os y muri&oacute;, creando un precedente.</li>  <li>Un empleado de una aerol&iacute;nea fue forzado a tomar un descanso de 20 minutos en vez de los dos descansos de 10 minutos que necesitaba para revisar su nivel de az&uacute;car, tomar insulina, y/o comer.</li>  <li>Un cajero con diabetes neurop&aacute;tica no pudo hacer su trabajo porque el empleador no le permit&iacute;a sentarse entre cliente y cliente.</li>  <li>Una persona con diabetes fue rechazada para la posici&oacute;n de oficial de polic&iacute;a porque la jefatura de polic&iacute;a municipal ten&iacute;a una pol&iacute;tica uniforme que reprobaba a todos los que usaban insulina &ndash; aunque los solicitantes hubieran tenido, por muchos a&ntilde;os, una carrera exitosa en una posici&oacute;n similar en otro condado.</li>  </ul>  <p>Estas situaciones reflejan los miedos y malentendidos entorno a esta condici&oacute;n. Al igual que con cualquier otra discapacidad, la ADA requiere que los empleadores observen las limitaciones actuales, no las limitaciones percibidas.</p>  </div>  <h2>Repercusiones de la Diabetes en el Lugar de Trabajo</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hay veces que a pesar de un control bueno de la dieta, medicinas, y ejercicios, algunas personas con diabetes pueden experimentar hipoglucemia o hiperglicemia. Sin embargo, la mayor&iacute;a de las personas con diabetes reconocen las se&ntilde;ales de advertencia de estas condiciones e inmediatamente toman la acci&oacute;n apropiada para regresar sus niveles de glucosa en la sangre y ponerse fuera de peligro.</p>  <p>Es importante que los empleadores hagan acomodaciones razonables que les permitan a las personas con diabetes revisar sus niveles de glucosa en la sangre haci&eacute;ndose ello mismos una prueba por medio de un piquete en un dedo (que toma menos de un minuto) y luego tom&aacute;ndose el medicamento (para los niveles altos de glucosa) o una fuente de az&uacute;car (para los niveles bajos de glucosa). S&oacute;lo toma unos minutos para que el nivel de az&uacute;car en la sangre de esta persona regrese a su nivel normal.</p>  <p>El riesgo de hipoglucemia, en general, no crea un peligro en el lugar de trabajo. Entonces, por ejemplo, no hay una raz&oacute;n para descalificar a una persona de un trabajo de oficina por la simple raz&oacute;n de que &eacute;l o ella experimentan hipoglucemia, a&uacute;n en los casos m&aacute;s extremos.</p>  <p>A&uacute;n en los empleos en los cuales una hipoglucemia severa puede crear peligros (por ejemplo, la posici&oacute;n de oficial de polic&iacute;a) no hay raz&oacute;n para descalificar a una persona simplemente porque &eacute;l o ella tienen diabetes o usan insulina. Al contrario, en la posici&oacute;n actual de ambos, la administraci&oacute;n de la diabetes y las interpretaciones judiciales de la ADA, han enfatizado que cada persona deber&aacute; ser evaluada individualmente. La Asociaci&oacute;n Americana de la Diabetes dice, <em> &ldquo;La diabetes como tal no debe ser una causa de discriminaci&oacute;n en contra de nadie en el empleo. Las personas con diabetes deber&aacute;n ser consideradas individualmente para un trabajo, tomando en cuenta factores tales como los requisitos o los peligros del trabajo en espec&iacute;fico, la condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica del individuo, y su r&eacute;gimen de tratamiento (la dieta, los agentes orales hipogluc&eacute;micos, y la insulina).Cualquier persona con diabetes, sin importar si es dependiente de insulina o no, debe de ser elegible para cualquier empleo para el cual &eacute;l o ella est&eacute;n, de otra forma, calificados.&rdquo;</em></p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; clase de trabajos pueden hacer las personas con diabetes?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las personas con diabetes tienen muy pocas restricciones. Los empleadores no deben de asumir que la diabetes aumentar&aacute; los peligros en la seguridad, y deber&aacute;n demostrar que cualquier prueba m&eacute;dica o investigaci&oacute;n hecha es relacionada y consistente con las necesidades de la empresa. Adem&aacute;s, los individuos deber&aacute;n ser evaluados en sus habilidades actuales para poder desempe&ntilde;ar con seguridad las funciones esenciales del empleo, no bas&aacute;ndose en la posibilidad de complicaciones futuras.</p>  <p>Los problemas pueden ocurrir en aquellos que no pueden evitar la hipoglucemia severa, y consecuentemente no deben de trabajar en &aacute;reas peligrosas. Sin embargo, como esto no es muy com&uacute;n, es el empleado, bas&aacute;ndose en sus experiencias, quien deber&aacute; tomar la decisi&oacute;n, no el empleador, a menos que el empleador pueda demostrar que un empleado hipoglic&eacute;mico representa un peligro directo a la salud o seguridad del lugar de trabajo. La diabetes es una condici&oacute;n muy individualizada. Idealmente, el empleado, su doctor, y el empleador, trabajar&aacute;n junto para asegurar el &eacute;xito.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodando razonablemente a una persona con diabetes</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>En su mayor&iacute;a, las personas con diabetes no deber&aacute;n necesitar de un tratamiento especial de sus supervisores. Simplemente, el entender la condici&oacute;n y la posibilidad de que se puedan necesitar horarios especiales de trabajo y recesos para comer, ser&iacute;a de mucha ayuda. Para poder tener una vida exitosa con diabetes, la persona debe ser auto-disciplinada, auto-consciente, y auto-responsable, caracter&iacute;sticas muy valiosas en muchos empleos.</p>  <p>La Ley para Personas con Discapacidades requiere a los empleadores que &ldquo;acomoden razonablemente&rdquo; las limitaciones impuestas por la discapacidad f&iacute;sica o mental de la persona. Las acomodaciones razonables son definidas como una modificaci&oacute;n o ajustes en el empleo, en las pr&aacute;cticas de empleo, o en el ambiente de trabajo que hacen posible que una persona con una discapacidad pueda ser empleada. La ley establece que el empleador necesita proveer acomodaciones desde el primer contacto con la persona con la discapacidad, durante el proceso de aplicaci&oacute;n, en el empleo, durante el entrenamiento, en el sitio de trabajo, y al considerar despidos y promociones. Si las responsabilidades del empleo cambian, tal vez se necesiten hacer nuevas acomodaciones.</p>  <p>La ADA requiere a un empleador provea acomodaciones a menos que hacerlo le cause una inconveniencia excesiva. Si un empleador se da cuenta que el costo de una acomodaci&oacute;n impondr&aacute; una inconveniencia excesiva y no hay ning&uacute;n tipo de fondos disponibles por otro medio, se le deber&aacute; ofrecer la opci&oacute;n, al solicitante o el empleado con la discapacidad, de que pague una parte del costo que implica una inconveniencia excesiva o por el costo para proveer la acomodaci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Si pensamos en las acomodaciones como &ldquo;reforzadores de productividad&rdquo; similares a otras herramientas en el lugar de trabajo, se convierten en parte del costo del negocio.</p>  <p>La ADA requiere que los empleadores provean acomodaciones s&oacute;lo para las discapacidades conocidas. La acomodaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s com&uacute;n que una persona con diabetes necesita es f&aacute;cil y virtualmente libre de costo: el tiempo y espacio para revisar sus niveles de glucosa y suministrarse el medicamento o la comida. Se deben de planear horarios para hacer estas acomodaciones. Tambi&eacute;n, si el empleado as&iacute; lo desea, se deber&aacute; proveer un lugar privado para que se haga la revisi&oacute;n. El empleado puede tambi&eacute;n necesitar de hacerse pruebas tantas veces lo necesite, cuando &eacute;l o ella se den cuenta que sus niveles de glucosa est&aacute;n empezando a subir o a bajar.</p>  <p>Algunas personas con diabetes experimentan complicaciones tales como la p&eacute;rdida de vista, da&ntilde;o en los nervios, o amputaciones que pueden requerir de acomodaciones adicionales.</p>  <p>Hay acomodaciones que pueden hacerse si la diabetes tiene como resultado la p&eacute;rdida de vista. Un equipo auxiliar para la deficiencia visual puede ser de mucha ayuda. El profesional del cuidado de los ojos del empleado, puede sugerir el uso de una lupa, luz apropiada, o material impreso m&aacute;s grande. Pueda ser que el empleado quiera contactar un centro de recursos locales para personas con ceguera o deficiencias visuales para obtener una evaluaci&oacute;n de su deficiencia visual en el trabajo y para que le ayuden a encontrar el equipo auxiliar necesario.</p>  <p>Otras personas pueden desarrollar complicaciones tales como neuropat&iacute;a o una amputaci&oacute;n que haga dif&iacute;cil el caminar. Estas condiciones pueden ser con frecuencia acomodadas con un m&iacute;nimo de acciones f&aacute;ciles como el permitirle al empleado sentarse mientras trabaja o limitando lo que camina facilitando un estacionamiento cercano o permiti&eacute;ndole tomar caminos m&aacute;s cortos para cruzar el establecimiento.</p>  <p>En algunos casos de diabetes, a pesar de los mejores esfuerzos en mantener un buen control del az&uacute;car en la sangre, el individuo va ha experimentar complicaciones de la diabetes que incluyen la p&eacute;rdida de vista, neuropat&iacute;a, amputaciones, enfermedades del coraz&oacute;n, y enfermedades del ri&ntilde;&oacute;n. Estas complicaciones pueden tener un impacto lo suficientemente grande para que la persona necesite aprender una forma alternativa para hacer las cosas. Puede ser que el empleado necesite tomar un tiempo fuera del trabajo para atender un programa formal de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional, en donde &eacute;l o ella aprender&aacute;n nuevas formas para desempe&ntilde;ar sus labores en el trabajo. El entrenamiento de rehabilitaci&oacute;n vocacional ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; a la persona como hacer las cosas con cuidado y seguridad (tal vez con un bast&oacute;n blanco), a usar equipo auxiliar de adaptabilidad, y quiz&aacute;s a desempe&ntilde;ar sus labores de trabajo en una forma un tanto diferente.</p>  </div>  <h2>Entrenamiento y Promociones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Para la mayor&iacute;a de personas con diabetes, el empleador no debe de tener dudas acerca de su capacidad al considerar talleres de entrenamiento o promociones. Si la diabetes del empleado le ha causado una limitaci&oacute;n significante en sus funciones, y si se ha planeado un entrenamiento, hable con el empleado acerca de las posibles acomodaciones que necesite en el sitio donde se va a llevar a cabo el entrenamiento.</p>  <p>Algunas de estas acomodaciones son:</p>  <ul>  <li>revisar regularmente el nivel de glucosa en la sangre y descansos para comer, igual que durante un d&iacute;a normal de trabajo</li>  <li>organizar el material para el entrenamiento en un formato alternativo, tal como en letras grandes</li>  <li>tener un compa&ntilde;ero que copie sus notas si el entrenamiento se hace en un cuarto oscuro</li>  </ul>  <p>Los empleadores deben suponer que las personas con diabetes tienen las mismas aspiraciones que cualquier otro empleado. En cuanto a transferencias y promociones, la diabetes de una persona no debe de importar al tomar decisiones. Hay que concentrarse s&oacute;lo en lo que es apropiado y que est&aacute; dentro de las habilidades que la persona tiene para desempe&ntilde;ar una nueva posici&oacute;n y determinar si se necesitan acomodaciones razonables. Habr&iacute;a que aprovechar las capacidades de la persona y acomodar las limitaciones para sacar la mayor productividad del empleado.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recursos</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p><strong>L&iacute;nea gratis del Centro Regional de Asesor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica en Discapacidades e Industria de la ADA </strong><br /> (800) 949-4232 (voz/TTY).</p>  <p><strong>Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo,</strong><br /> 1801 calle L, NW, Washington, DC 20507, <br /> (800) 669-4000 (voz), (800) 800-3302 (TTY), <br /> (800) 666-3362(publicaciones). <br /> Para m&aacute;s informaci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol acuda a la Red Electr&oacute;nica: http://www.eeoc.gov/languages/spanish/index.html</p>  <p><strong>Asociaci&oacute;n Americana de la Diabetes</strong><br /> 1701 Norte de la calle Beauregard, Alexandria, VA 22311, <br /> 1-800-DIABETES (342-2383)</p>  <p>Si las funciones visuales son afectadas por la diabetes, el empleador o el empleado pueden contactar la oficina local de la <strong>Comisi&oacute;n (o Servicios) para Personas con Ceguera y Deficiencia Visual</strong>.

Llega en cualquier momento a cualquier edad y a todas las &aacute;reas demogr&aacute;ficas. Son muy pocas las personas que no han sido afectadas por el c&aacute;ncer, ya sea porque lo tienen, conocen o tienen a un familiar con c&aacute;ncer o porque tienen un amigo que tiene o ha tenido c&aacute;ncer.</p>  <p>La palabra &ldquo;c&aacute;ncer&rdquo; se refiere al tipo de enfermedades que se caracterizan por el crecimiento incontrolable de c&eacute;lulas anormales. Tambi&eacute;n se caracteriza por el esparcimiento de c&eacute;lulas anormales. Los cient&iacute;ficos no saben con exactitud c&oacute;mo es que se forma un determinado tipo de c&aacute;ncer, pero se cree que es causado por una combinaci&oacute;n de factores externos e internos. Si no se trata con tiempo, el c&aacute;ncer puede causar la muerte.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup>Cancer Facts and Figures 2001, page 2, American Cancer Society, Inc. 2001</div>  </div>  <h2>?C&oacute;mo se puede tratar el c&aacute;ncer? <sup>2</sup></h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El c&aacute;ncer, generalmente, es tratado por varios m&eacute;todos diferentes, incluyendo cirug&iacute;a, radiaci&oacute;n, quimioterapia, tratamientos con hormonas e inmunoterapia. Muchos de estos tratamientos requieren un tiempo significante de convalecencia, adem&aacute;s de que pueden causar efectos secundarios muy severos.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>2</sup>Cancer Facts and Figures 2002, page 2, American Cancer Society, Inc. 2001</div>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;A qui&eacute;n le da c&aacute;ncer? <sup>3</sup></h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Nadie es inmune al c&aacute;ncer. La mayor&iacute;a de gente no desarrolla el c&aacute;ncer sino hasta en su madurez. Un porcentaje muy alto [80%] de c&aacute;nceres son diagnosticados al cumplirse los 55 a&ntilde;os o despu&eacute;s. Muchas de esas personas, por lo tanto, son diagnosticadas mucho antes de su jubilaci&oacute;n. Un n&uacute;mero aproximado de 8.9 millones de americanos con historial de c&aacute;ncer estaban vivos en 1997. De estos 8.9 millones, algunos ya se han curado, otros est&aacute;n viviendo con c&aacute;ncer y otros m&aacute;s est&aacute;n en tratamiento.</p>  <p>Seg&uacute;n la Sociedad Americana del C&aacute;ncer, se espera diagnosticar cerca de 1, 268,000 casos nuevos de c&aacute;ncer en el a&ntilde;o 2001. Se anticipa que en este mismo a&ntilde;o m&aacute;s de medio mill&oacute;n de americanos morir&aacute;n de c&aacute;ncer. Un 25% de muertes en los Estados Unidos son por causa del c&aacute;ncer, lo cual lo convierte en la segunda causa principal de muertes en el pa&iacute;s.</p>  <p>Sin embargo, hay mucha gente que sobrevive a esta enfermedad. El porcentaje que sobrevive a cualquier combinaci&oacute;n de c&aacute;ncer por cinco a&ntilde;os es de un 60%. Este porcentaje representa a las personas que viven m&aacute;s de cinco a&ntilde;os y aun despu&eacute;s de ser diagnosticadas con c&aacute;ncer, ya sea, sin c&aacute;ncer, en remisi&oacute;n, o en tratamiento. Tambi&eacute;n es importante reconocer que este porcentaje de sobre-vivencia es basados en pacientes que fueron diagnosticados, cuando menos, ocho a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s y, por lo tanto, no reflejan los avances actuales en los tratamientos. Por lo tanto, puede ser que el porcentaje que sobrevive haya aumentado, pero no hay aun estad&iacute;sticas disponibles para analizar el porcentaje actual de sobre-vivencia.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup> Cancer Facts and Figures 2002, pages 3-4, American Cancer Society, Inc. 2001</div>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; problemas puede confrontar en el trabajo una persona que tiene c&aacute;ncer?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Puede haber muchos problemas que se suciten en el trabajo para las personas con c&aacute;ncer. Para mucha gente con c&aacute;ncer, es extraordinariamente importante el poder mantener su trabajo. Para muchos de nosotros, el poder ir a trabajar es una de las formas por las cuales nos definimos. Adem&aacute;s de proveer una fuente de sustento, el ir a trabajar nos ayuda a enfocarnos en cosas diferentes a la enfermedad mientras se est&aacute; bajo tratamiento para el c&aacute;ncer.</p>  <p>Adicionalmente, con la llegada de muchos tipos de tratamientos, incluyendo formas de minimizar los efectos secundarios, mucha gente puede continuar trabajando mientras est&aacute;n bajo tratamientos de radiaci&oacute;n y quimioterapia. Otras personas en esta misma condici&oacute;n podr&iacute;an necesitar tomar un tiempo libre para recibir el tratamiento, pero podr&aacute;n regresar a trabajar una vez concluido el tratamiento.</p>  <p>Para la gente con c&aacute;ncer, es tambi&eacute;n de suma importancia el poder conservar su seguro de salud. Por lo tanto, los trabajadores tambi&eacute;n desean mantener su empleo, o poder regresar a su empleo, y as&iacute; mantener su seguro de salud.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; leyes aplican a los empleados con c&aacute;ncer?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p><strong>La ley para Personas con Discapacidades </strong><sup>4</sup> <br /> En 1990, el Congreso pas&oacute; la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades [ADA], por sus siglas en ingl&eacute;s. El ADA es una ley muy extensa. La ley proh&iacute;be discriminaci&oacute;n en todas las &aacute;reas del proceso de empleo. Un individuo est&aacute; protegido en el proceso de solicitud, pruebas, aceptaci&oacute;n, designaci&oacute;n, ex&aacute;menes m&eacute;dicos, promociones, despidos temporales, compensaci&oacute;n, beneficios y ausencias. Es una ley de derechos humanos y fue designada para nivelar el &aacute;rea de juego en la arena de empleo &ndash; para que no se le niegue empleo a la gente, o beneficios de trabajo, simplemente porque tienen una discapacidad.</p>  <p><strong>&iquest;A qui&eacute;n afecta la ADA?</strong></p>  <ul>  <li>Empleadores &ndash;La ADA afecta a todos los empleadores particulares con 15 o m&aacute;s empleados. Tambi&eacute;n afecta a agencias de empleos, sindicatos laborales y a los gobiernos locales y del condado.<sup>5</sup></li>  <li>Solicitantes/Empleados&mdash;La ADA provee protecci&oacute;n a la &ldquo;persona capacitada con una discapacidad.&rdquo; Esta es una prueba con dos divisiones. Un individuo tiene que estar, a la misma vez, discapacitado y capacitado.</li>  </ul>  <p>Un individuo con una discapacidad reconocida bajo los estatutos de la ADA, es un individuo con un limitaci&oacute;n f&iacute;sico o mental que limita sus actividades cotidianas. Las actividades cotidianas pueden ser, entre otras cosas, conversar, ver, respirar, trabajar o el cuidarse por s&iacute; solo. Una persona puede tener una discapacidad si tiene un expediente de su limitaci&oacute;n o si es considerado como que tiene una limitaci&oacute;n. La discapacidad que limite considerablemente su vida cotidiana debe de ser severa, no temporal y debe de causarle un impacto duradero o permanente.</p>  <p>Para determinar si la limitaci&oacute;n es considerablemente limitante, la discapacidad deber&aacute; ser observada en su etapa corregida o disminuida.6 Por lo tanto, se deber&aacute; de observar la condici&oacute;n que el individuo ten&iacute;a en el momento cuando alega que tal discriminaci&oacute;n haya ocurrido, incluyendo si el individuo ha tenido cirug&iacute;as previas y la situaci&oacute;n actual en referencia a su programa de tratamiento. Se deber&aacute;n de observar, tambi&eacute;n, los medicamentos que el individuo est&eacute; tomando para controlar el c&aacute;ncer, incluyendo los efectos secundarios causados por la radiaci&oacute;n y quimioterapia o cualquier otro tratamiento.</p>  <p>Si el c&aacute;ncer en la persona ya ha sido controlado amplia o completamente a trav&eacute;s de cirug&iacute;a, radiaci&oacute;n y quimioterapia, puede ser que &eacute;l/ella no tenga una discapacidad calificada bajo los estatutos de la ADA porque &eacute;l/ella no podr&aacute; demostrar el impacto que tal discapacidad le causa en el desarrollo de sus funciones principales en su vida. Sin embargo, puede ser que esta persona s&iacute; est&eacute; protegida bajo alguna de las otras dos definiciones de discapacidad de la ADA; o sea que, &eacute;l/ella pueda tener un historial cl&iacute;nico de una discapacidad o que el empleador lo considere como una persona discapacitada.</p>  <p>Para que alguien reciba protecci&oacute;n, deber&aacute; tambi&eacute;n estar &ldquo;capacitado&rdquo;. Lo cual quiere decir que el individuo deber&aacute; poder cumplir con los quehaceres m&iacute;nimos requeridos por el trabajo con o sin acomodaciones razonables. Esto puede requerir el precisar cu&aacute;les sean las funciones esenciales del trabajo frente a las funciones marginales. Por ejemplo, si una persona es recepcionista y no puede contestar el tel&eacute;fono debido a su discapacidad y no hay un equipo accesible disponible, puede ser que esta persona no pueda realizar las funciones esenciales del trabajo. Si la persona es un chofer de cami&oacute;n y tiene que mover materiales pesados de la bodega al cami&oacute;n, puede ser que esa persona no sea un individuo capacitado, a menos que haya acomodaciones razonables, porque el mover esos materiales pesados bien podr&iacute;a ser una de las funciones esenciales del trabajo.</p>  <p>Ahora, supongamos que el empleado con c&aacute;ncer tiene la posici&oacute;n de vendedor y que puede manejar los contactos por tel&eacute;fono, las citas individuales y todo el papeleo y procesamiento de datos as&iacute; requerido. Sin embargo, esta persona no puede mover las cajas con el material de venta de su oficina a su carro. Esta persona puede que sea un individuo capacitado con una discapacidad. Si otra persona puede llevarle las cajas al carro, bajo los estatutos de la ADA esto es una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, o el efecto de mover las cajas al carro puede ser considerado como una de las funciones marginales del trabajo.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>4</sup>42 U.S.C.A. ? 12101 et seq.

Garret, 51, U.S. 356 (2001)], muchos estados tienen legislaturas pendientes que pudieran comprometer al estado por violaciones a la ADA.

Algunos ejemplos de acomodaciones razonables incluyen un horario flexible, una posici&oacute;n con funciones f&aacute;ciles de llevar, un periodo largo de ausencias permitidas, o una reasignaci&oacute;n a una posici&oacute;n vacante. De acuerdo a algunas interpretaciones de la ADA por algunos tribunales, la asistencia al trabajo puede ser una funci&oacute;n esencial del trabajo; sin embargo, otros juzgados han dictaminado, que un largo periodo de ausencias pagadas o sin pagar puede ser considerado como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. Cada situaci&oacute;n deber&aacute; ser evaluada individualmente, incluyendo si las acomodaciones razonables pudieran crear inconveniencias excesivas al empleador.</p>  <p>La ADA no provee una lista espec&iacute;fica de las acomodaciones razonables &ndash; estas deber&aacute;n ser de com&uacute;n acuerdo y mediante un di&aacute;logo entre el individuo y el empleador y deber&aacute;n ser basadas en la situaci&oacute;n y tipo espec&iacute;fico de trabajo y en el tama&ntilde;o y los medios que tenga la empresa. Adem&aacute;s, las acomodaciones son requeridas solamente para las discapacidades conocidas del individuo --- primeramente, el empleador deber&aacute; estar consciente que el individuo que busca una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable est&aacute; amparado por la ley de la ADA. Tambi&eacute;n depende del individuo que necesite tales acomodaciones el hacer sugerencias al empleador acerca del tipo de acomodaciones razonables que &eacute;l/ella est&eacute; pidiendo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; otra cosa establece la ADA?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Si un futuro empleado est&aacute; solicitando un trabajo nuevo, &eacute;l/ella no necesita revelar su condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica. El/ella puede pedir las acomodaciones razonables despu&eacute;s de haber conseguido el trabajo. Si una persona tiene un impedimento visible, el futuro empleador puede preguntar al futuro empleado c&oacute;mo el/ella har&aacute; para desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones de su trabajo y pedir que le muestre.</p>  <p>Si una persona recibe un ofrecimiento condicional de un trabajo basado en los resultados de un examen medico, dicha condici&oacute;n y examen m&eacute;dico deber&aacute;n ser requeridos por todos los empleados en la misma categor&iacute;a. El ofrecimiento no puede ser invalidado a menos que el examen m&eacute;dico indique que la persona no puede desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del trabajo a&uacute;n con las acomodaciones razonables.</p>  <p>Finalmente, cualquier petici&oacute;n de acomodaciones razonables, seg&uacute;n los t&eacute;rminos de la ADA, deber&aacute; ser guardada confidencialmente. La petici&oacute;n del individuo y cualquier informaci&oacute;n obtenida para respaldar la petici&oacute;n deber&aacute;n ser guardadas en un expediente separado de su archivo personal.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; otras leyes pudieran aplicarse en el lugar de trabajo?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hay otras leyes que pueden proveer protecci&oacute;n a los empleados en el lugar de trabajo. La ADA puede trabajar de la mano con otra ley, la Ley de Licencias de Ausentismo por razones Familiares y M&eacute;dicas,<sup>7</sup> FMLA, por sus siglas en ingl&eacute;s. El FMLA le permite a una persona tomar un m&aacute;ximo de 12 semanas sin pago por ausencia m&eacute;dica para cuidar a sus padres, un hijo o a su c&oacute;nyuge. Tambi&eacute;n permite un m&aacute;ximo de 12 semanas de ausencia sin paga por alguna condici&oacute;n m&eacute;dica del empleado. Aunque es sin paga (a menos que el empleador le pida usar sus d&iacute;as de ausencia por enfermedad y/o sus d&iacute;as de vacaciones que le correspondan por a&ntilde;o o que el empleado decida hacer uso de los mismos), el empleado no pierde el trabajo, lo cual quiere decir que el empleado regresar&aacute; a su posici&oacute;n que ten&iacute;a al momento de ausentarse o a una posici&oacute;n equivalente. La ley tambi&eacute;n requiere que el empleador conserve los beneficios del empleado intactos.</p>  <p>El FMLA se aplica a empleadores con 50 o m&aacute;s empleados. Los empleados cubiertos bajo esta ley deber&aacute;n tener por lo menos un a&ntilde;o de haber sido empleados o haber trabajado un m&iacute;nimo de 1,250 horas en ese a&ntilde;o. Habr&aacute; casos en que la persona requiera m&aacute;s de las 12 semanas sin paga as&iacute; provistas por el FMLA. En ese caso, la persona podr&aacute; tomar un per&iacute;odo de ausencia considerado como una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable y en conformidad con la ADA.</p>  <p>Asimismo, puede ser que haya leyes que provean igual o mayor protecci&oacute;n que la provista por el FMLA o la ADA. Cada empleador deber&aacute; revisar las leyes aplicables del estado y as&iacute; determinar los derechos y responsabilidades que tienen el empleador y sus empleados conforme a esas leyes.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>7</sup>29 U.S.C.A &sect;&sect;2601-2615 (2001).</div>  </div>  <h2>Trabajando unidos</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El c&aacute;ncer puede ser una experiencia que puede cambiarle la vida, no s&oacute;lo a la persona con c&aacute;ncer, sino tambi&eacute;n a todos los que lo rodean, incluyendo familiares, amigos, compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo y empleadores.

Esto es consistente con las Secciones 503 y 504 de la Ley de Rehabilitaci&oacute;n de 1973 y el decreto federal no-discriminatorio que precede la ADA. De hecho, un 13% de los que inician una demanda por discriminaci&oacute;n en el empleo bajo la ADA se describen as&iacute; mismos como individuos con discapacidades emocionales o psiqui&aacute;tricas, lo cual, hasta la fecha, lo coloca en el segundo lugar m&aacute;s citado del tipo de demandas entre las discapacidades m&aacute;s comunes &ndash; siendo rebasado solamente por demandas de discapacidades de la espalda, que suman un 18% del total de todas las demandas.</p>  <p>La cobertura de la ley ADA est&aacute; limitada a individuos con &ldquo;discapacidades mentales o f&iacute;sicas&rdquo; que &ldquo;limitan considerablemente una o m&aacute;s de sus actividades cotidianas al utilizar medidas atenuantes.&rdquo;&sup1; Cuando se toma una medida atenuante, la ley tambi&eacute;n toma en consideraci&oacute;n cualquier limitaci&oacute;n y efectos secundarios restantes. La ADA tambi&eacute;n protege a individuos con un historial de discapacidad al igual que a individuos que se les considera discapacitados. De este modo, los individuos que en la actualidad no tienen una discapacidad f&iacute;sica o mental que limite considerablemente una o m&aacute;s de sus actividades cotidianas quedar&iacute;an aun bajo el amparo de la ADA en caso que una entidad cubierta discrimine en contra de ellos bas&aacute;ndose en el historial de una discapacidad o porque sean considerados personas con discapacidades.</p>  <p>Los individuos con diagnosis psiqui&aacute;tricos tales como una depresi&oacute;n mayor, trastorno bipolar (llamado con anterioridad enfermedad maniaco-depresiva), y esquizofrenia pueden estar amparados, dependiendo en como su condici&oacute;n afecta su funcionamiento. Individuos con otra enfermedad psiqui&aacute;trica (tal como ansiedad, personalidad, disociaci&oacute;n, o trastorno postraum&aacute;tico del estr&eacute;s) puede ser incluido en la definici&oacute;n de ADA.</p>  <p>La ley ADA, usualmente, no cubre discapacidades a corto plazo o que no limitan en forma significativa la habilidad para que un individuo pueda hacer sus labores cotidianas. Por ejemplo, individuos con un problema de salud leve o de corto plazo, usualmente, no re&uacute;nen los requisitos de la definici&oacute;n de discapacidad bajo los estatutos de la ADA.&sup2;</p>  <p>Hay mucho debate acerca de la terminolog&iacute;a preferida para referirse a individuos con discapacidad psiqui&aacute;trica. Otros nombres que son com&uacute;nmente utilizados son &ldquo;persona con una discapacidad de salud mental,&rdquo; &ldquo;consumidores de salud mental,&rdquo; persona con una enfermedad mental,&rdquo; &ldquo;cliente de salud mental,&rdquo; o &ldquo;sobreviviente psiqui&aacute;trico.&rdquo;</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>1</sup> Sutton V.

Una diagnosis de retraso mental es caracterizada, principalmente, por limitaciones en las funciones intelectuales, as&iacute; como dificultades con ciertas destrezas de la vida diaria. Por definici&oacute;n, el retraso mental empieza antes de cumplir los 18 a&ntilde;os.</p>  <p>En contraste, las funciones intelectuales de una persona con discapacidad psiqui&aacute;trica var&iacute;a al igual que en toda la poblaci&oacute;n en general. Los s&iacute;ntomas de enfermedades mentales pueden incluir alteraciones emocionales, trastornos de pensamiento, o problemas de percepci&oacute;n.</p>  <p>Una enfermedad mental puede desarrollarse a cualquier edad, desde la infancia hasta la vejez. El trastorno bipolar y la esquizofrenia tienen un grado muy alto de aparici&oacute;n temprano en la madurez. Es por eso que hay muchos individuos con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas que entran a la universidad antes de experimentar los primeros s&iacute;ntomas.</p>  <p><em><strong>Mito #3:</strong> Las personas con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas son m&aacute;s propensas a ser violentas.</em> No es hasta que se enteran que un aspirante tiene un historial de tratamiento psiqui&aacute;trico, que algunos empleadores pueden suponer que este individuo es m&aacute;s propenso a ser violento. Este mito est&aacute; reforzado por las interpretaciones de personas con desorden mental en las pel&iacute;culas, la televisi&oacute;n, y las noticias como unas personas con un temperamento impredecible y violento.</p>  <p>De acuerdo con la Asociaci&oacute;n Nacional de Salud Mental, &ldquo;los actos violentos cometidos por personas con desorden mental representan una peque&ntilde;a fracci&oacute;n de la violencia perpetrada en Los Estados Unidos, aunque esos actos son con frecuencia causan gran sensaci&oacute;n entre los medios de comunicaci&oacute;n y llevan a continuar la estigmatizaci&oacute;n de las personas con des&oacute;rdenes mentales.&rdquo;<sup>5</sup></p>  <p><em><strong>Mito #4:</strong> No es posible recuperarse de un desorden mental.</em> Por muchas d&eacute;cadas, personas con des&oacute;rdenes mentales eran separadas del resto de la sociedad por medio de la institucionalizaci&oacute;n y eran puestos en hospitales para enfermos mentales. Se cre&iacute;a que un desorden mental era permanente e intratable.</p>  <p>La pol&iacute;tica p&uacute;blica empez&oacute; a cambiar hacia el final del a&ntilde;o 1950 y al empiezo del a&ntilde;o 1960 al ir d&aacute;ndonos cuenta que cientos de miles de ciudadanos estadounidenses estaban siendo separados innecesariamente. Fueron descubiertas nuevas medicinas que ayudaban a mitigar los s&iacute;ntomas de des&oacute;rdenes mentales, y hubo una evoluci&oacute;n gradual hacia el suministro de tratamiento y servicios de rehabilitaci&oacute;n en la comunidad. Estudios a largo-plazo han demostrado que la mayor&iacute;a de personas con desorden mental, con el paso del tiempo, muestran una mejor&iacute;a genuina y hasta llegar a tener una vida estable y productiva.</p>  <p>El &eacute;xito de figuras importantes con desordenes mentales, ha ayudado a informar al p&uacute;blico de que s&iacute; es posible llegar a curarse y recuperarse de una enfermedad mental. El Psic&oacute;logo y Profesor Kay Redfield Jamison ha escrito varios libros populares acerca de su propia experiencia con trastorno bipolar. Un libro de Kathy Conkrite titulado, \"Al borde de la oscuridad&rdquo;, figura relatos personales de Mike Wallace, Joan Rivers, William Styron, Kitty Dukakis, y otros m&aacute;s acerca de su lucha y &eacute;xito venciendo la depresi&oacute;n.</p>  <p><em><strong>Mito #5:</strong> Las personas con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas no pueden tolerar el estr&eacute;s en el empleo.</em> Este mito exagera la respuesta compleja del ser humano al estr&eacute;s. Es posible que a las personas con una variedad de condiciones m&eacute;dicas &ndash; incluyendo enfermedades cardiovasculares, esclerosis m&uacute;ltiple, y trastornos psiqui&aacute;tricos, - se den cuenta que sus s&iacute;ntomas se agravan cuando tienen niveles altos de estr&eacute;s. Pero el origen del estr&eacute;s personal o por el trabajo var&iacute;a mucho de un individuo a otro. Algunas personas encuentran que un horario desorganizado de trabajo les causa mucho estr&eacute;s, mientras que otras batallan con un r&eacute;gimen estricto de trabajo. Algunas personas se crecen en un sitio p&uacute;blico, mientras que otras necesitan estar solos para concentrarse y ser productivos. Est&aacute; claro que los empleados con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas, tambi&eacute;n, var&iacute;an en sus reacciones a las tensiones en el trabajo.</p>  <p>Todos los empleos son estresantes hasta cierto punto. La productividad se maximiza cuando hay una buena concordancia entre las necesidades del empleado y sus condiciones de trabajo &ndash; no importando si la persona tiene o no una discapacidad psiqui&aacute;trica.</p>  <hr />  <div class=\"footnote\"><sup>3</sup> Kessler, R.

Adem&aacute;s, la ADA proh&iacute;be a los empleadores preguntarles a los aspirantes a un empleo si tienen discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas antes de hacerles una oferta de trabajo. Algunos ejemplos de preguntas no permitidas durante la entrevista, y as&iacute; dictadas por la ADA, incluyen las siguientes: &iquest;Ha estado hospitalizado? &iquest;Ha tenido una enfermedad fuerte en los &uacute;ltimos cinco a&ntilde;os? &iquest;Ha consultado alguna vez a un psiquiatra o psic&oacute;logo? &iquest;Cu&aacute;ntos d&iacute;as de trabajo perdi&oacute; por causa de enfermedad en el a&ntilde;o pasado? &iquest;Est&aacute; tomando alg&uacute;n tipo de drogas recetada por un doctor?</p>  <p>Para poder determinar si un aspirante califica para el empleo se deber&aacute;n de identificar cuales son las funciones esenciales del empleo durante el proceso de selecci&oacute;n, para luego buscar pruebas de que el aspirante tiene la destreza, experiencia en el trabajo, educaci&oacute;n y otras calificaciones necesarias.</p>  <p>Una vez dadas estas directrices, no hay forma de que un empleador pueda saber si un aspirante tiene una discapacidad psiqui&aacute;trica, a menos que &eacute;l o ella decidan revelarlo. Por ejemplo, un trabajador puede decidir revelar que &eacute;l o ella tienen una discapacidad de forma que puedan solicitar acomodaciones en el trabajo. No obstante, algunos trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas no requieren acomodaciones. Los aspirantes y empleados son, con frecuencia, disuadidos de discutir sus discapacidades con el empleador por miedo al estigma asociado con los trastornos psiqui&aacute;tricos que tiene nuestra sociedad. La revelaci&oacute;n de una discapacidad es una decisi&oacute;n muy personal del trabajador y que envuelve muchos factores incluyendo la confianza, el sentirse confortable con los dem&aacute;s empleados, la seguridad laboral, y el apoyo y la percepci&oacute;n de que su supervisor es de una mentalidad abierta.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;C&oacute;mo pueden afectar las discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas el funcionamiento de un individuo en el lugar de trabajo?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Es imposible generalizar acerca de las caracter&iacute;sticas de toda la gente con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas. Cuando se les ha preguntado c&oacute;mo su trastorno mental afecta su funcionamiento en el trabajo, algunos trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas citan dificultades para mantener la concentraci&oacute;n. Los trabajadores que toman medicamentos para controlar sus s&iacute;ntomas psiqui&aacute;tricos pueden experimentar efectos secundarios como temblor en las manos, sed excesiva, o visi&oacute;n borrosa. Algunos individuos reportan dificultades para enfocarse simult&aacute;neamente en tareas m&uacute;ltiples, particularmente en medio del ruido y distracciones.</p>  <p>Por supuesto, la fortaleza y debilidad de cada aspirante o empleado deber&aacute; ser evaluada individualmente, sin tomar en cuenta si tiene o no una discapacidad. La habilidad de un trabajador para poder desempe&ntilde;ar su empleo depender&aacute; de su experiencia en el trabajo, su entrenamiento y sus habilidades, y no simplemente porque haya tenido o no un diagn&oacute;stico psiqui&aacute;trico.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; clases de acomodaciones pueden ayudar a un trabajador con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Esta es una de las preguntas m&aacute;s frecuentes. El Colegio de Relaciones Industriales y Laborales de la Universidad de Cornell ha conducido estudios con empleadores del gobierno federal y privado con respecto al manejo y pr&aacute;cticas de la ADA y las acomodaciones. En ambos estudios, los participantes dijeron que hay una gran necesidad de informaci&oacute;n acerca de las acomodaciones para personas con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas (un 69% de empleadores federal y un 65% de los empleadores sin afiliaci&oacute;n al gobierno federal).<sup>6</sup></p>  <p>El tener buenas pr&aacute;cticas de administraci&oacute;n producir&iacute;a muchas de las acomodaciones necesarias en el lugar de empleo para las personas con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas. Al igual que todos los empleados, los trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas pueden beneficiarse con supervisores que:</p>  <ul>  <li>traten a cada empleado con una mente abierta acerca de su potencial y habilidades,</li>  <li>definan claramente las expectaciones de su desempe&ntilde;o,</li>  <li>den comentarios positivos, constructivos, cr&iacute;ticos y oportunos acerca de su desempe&ntilde;o,</li>  <li>est&eacute;n disponibles con regularidad durante la jornada de trabajo para consultar con los empleados</li>  <li>demuestren flexibilidad e imparcialidad al administrar las reglas y asignaciones de trabajo.</li>  </ul>  <p>Adem&aacute;s de una supervisi&oacute;n de alta calidad, algunos trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas se pueden beneficiar de una o m&aacute;s de las siguientes acomodaciones:</p>  <ul>  <li>horarios que incorporen tiempo-flexible, posiciones de tiempo parcial o compartimiento de las tareas, permisos para asistir a grupos de apoyo o citas m&eacute;dicas programadas,</li>  <li>acomodar la hora de descanso de acuerdo a las necesidades del individuo en vez de un horario fijo,</li>  <li>arreglos en la estructura (tales como divisiones en los cuartos o una oficina en un espacio cerrado) para reducir el ruido o las distracciones visuales,</li>  <li>ofreciendo permisos adicionales que le permitan a un trabajador regresar a su trabajo despu&eacute;s de una hospitalizaci&oacute;n,</li>  <li>permitiendo a los trabajadores, durante la jornada de trabajo, llamar a sus amigos y familiares que proveen apoyo, o a profesionales que los est&eacute;n tratando,</li>  <li>reuniones junto con el empleado, supervisor, entrenador de trabajo y otro proveedor de servicios de empleo.</li>  </ul>  <p>Estos son s&oacute;lo unos pocos ejemplos de las muchas acomodaciones para trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas que han sido implementadas exitosamente. Las acomodaciones eficaces para un trabajador con discapacidades son siempre determinadas caso-por-caso. La Red de Acomodaciones Laborales en el 1-(800) 232-9675, provee consultas gratis a empleadores e individuos con discapacidades acerca de acomodaciones en el lugar de trabajo.

Para lograr esta meta, se requiere que los empleadores vean m&aacute;s all&aacute; de los estereotipos y que eval&uacute;en las calificaciones y el desempe&ntilde;o de los trabajadores con discapacidades psiqui&aacute;tricas bas&aacute;ndose en la situaci&oacute;n de cada individuo en particular.

MS es diagnosticado com&uacute;nmente en mujeres cauc&aacute;sicas con descendencia del norte de Europa que tienen entre 18 y 30 a&ntilde;os. Las personas que viven con MS son empleadas con menos frecuencia que otras. Aunque un 95% de personas con MS tienen un historial de empleo, encuestas hechas a personas de 5 a 15 a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s de ser diagnosticados, muestran que menos del 25% siguen trabajando. Hay muchas razones que pueden ser la causa de este &iacute;ndice tan alto de desempleo, pero est&aacute; claro que muchas personas que viven con MS preferir&iacute;an estar trabajando y con unas acomodaciones m&iacute;nimas podr&iacute;an trabajar productivamente.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; es la Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple (MS)?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>MS es una enfermedad cr&oacute;nica que se caracteriza por la destrucci&oacute;n de la materia &ldquo;blanca&rdquo; en el sistema nervioso &ndash; la capa de Mielina que protege los nervios y permite una transmisi&oacute;n ininterrumpida de impulsos nerviosos. Esta desmielinaci&oacute;n progresiva se presenta inicialmente como un proceso de inflamaci&oacute;n que lleva ultimadamente a la destrucci&oacute;n del nervio. A esta inflamaci&oacute;n inicial se le llama &ldquo;exacerbaci&oacute;n&rdquo; y puede, con frecuencia, ser tratado usando medicamentos para disminuir el residuo da&ntilde;ado. Se piensa que MS es un trastorno que se desarrolla de una interacci&oacute;n compleja de exposici&oacute;n temprana a infecciones m&uacute;ltiples y a una vulnerabilidad gen&eacute;tica. Hay nuevos medicamentos y otros tratamientos que parecen ser efectivos alterando el curso de la enfermedad en muchas personas con MS. Los investigadores creen que la curaci&oacute;n no est&aacute; muy lejos del horizonte. Es importante que los empleadores y compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo entiendan que la MS no es una enfermedad contagiosa: no puede ser transmitida a otros bajo ninguna circunstancia.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Cu&aacute;les son los cursos diferentes que puede tomar la Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple (MS)?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hay tres cursos principales que la MS puede tomar. En el curso de &ldquo;recayendo-remitiendo&rdquo;, las personas experimentan &ldquo;reca&iacute;das&rdquo; o s&iacute;ntomas de &ldquo;ataque&rdquo;, tambi&eacute;n conocidos como exacerbaciones. Las personas experimentan una recuperaci&oacute;n parcial o total de sus funciones despu&eacute;s de estas exacerbaciones. Esta es la forma m&aacute;s com&uacute;n de MS en los Estados Unidos. Para algunas personas, el curso de recayendo-remitiendo se da en forma progresiva conforme envejecen &ndash; o sea, las reca&iacute;das son menos evidentes y los s&iacute;ntomas progresan a un ritmo constante. Este es el curso &ldquo;progresivo secundario&rdquo;. Una minor&iacute;a de personas con MS tienen el curso &ldquo;progresivo primario&rdquo; en el cual los s&iacute;ntomas progresan sin remisi&oacute;n. El entender cual curso est&aacute; tomando la MS es crucial para el dise&ntilde;o de acomodaciones efectivas en el empleo.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Cu&aacute;les son los s&iacute;ntomas asociados con la Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple (MS)?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Es imposible predecir cu&aacute;les s&iacute;ntomas tendr&aacute; un individuo con MS, ya que puede experimentar s&iacute;ntomas o limitaciones durante una exacerbaci&oacute;n que se pueden resolver o causar menos problemas durante la remisi&oacute;n. Es porque el MS es una enfermedad del sistema central nervioso que puede causar muchos tipos de limitaciones dependiendo en donde la &ldquo;explosi&oacute;n&rdquo; ocurra. La limitaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s com&uacute;n de las personas que viven con MS es la fatiga &ndash; lo que la gente con MS se refiere como fatiga MS porque es m&aacute;s fuerte que la fatiga que la mayor&iacute;a de la gente conoce. Las personas pueden tambi&eacute;n experimentar dificultades con la vista y al caminar o al usar sus manos. Algunas personas tienen dificultad controlando sus ganas de orinar o defecar. El balance tambi&eacute;n puede ser afectado, al igual que la sensaci&oacute;n (por ejemplo, en las manos o en las puntas de los dedos). Una limitaci&oacute;n problem&aacute;tica experimentada por algunas personas que viven con MS est&aacute; relacionada con los cambios cognitivos, que pueden incluir problemas con la memoria, manejando tareas m&uacute;ltiples, y pensando y respondiendo r&aacute;pido. Es importante que los familiares, empleadores y compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo recuerden que, porque la mayor&iacute;a de personas que viven con MS tienen s&iacute;ntomas de recayendo y remitiendo, un individuo puede experimentar mucha fatiga, cambios de la visi&oacute;n, problemas al caminar, y problemas de la memoria durante una exacerbaci&oacute;n y tener muchas de esas limitaciones resueltas una o dos semanas despu&eacute;s de haber recibido tratamiento a base de medicamentos y descanso. En muchas formas, lo imprevisible de la enfermedad, y la dificultad que otros tienen &ldquo;viendo&rdquo; las limitaciones, es tan frustrante como las mismas limitaciones. Para muchos, el vivir con MS es vivir con una discapacidad que no es visible &ndash; una discapacidad que es dif&iacute;cil para &eacute;l o ella entenderla y aun m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil de asimilar para los empleadores, compa&ntilde;eros de trabajo y otros. Y aun as&iacute;, cuando ambos, el individuo con MS y los dem&aacute;s, est&aacute;n debidamente informados, pueda ser que el individuo pueda continuar trabajando productivamente.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodaciones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El T&iacute;tulo I de la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades (ADA), protege a individuos calificados con discapacidades en contra de la discriminaci&oacute;n en el empleo por causas de discapacidades. El determinar si una persona tiene una discapacidad (se deben de tomar en cuenta las medidas que contribuyen a minorar los s&iacute;ntomas como el tomar medicamentos), o si califica para la posici&oacute;n en cuesti&oacute;n deber&aacute; hacerse siempre observando cada caso individualmente, muchas personas que viven con MS son consideradas &ldquo;individuos calificados con una discapacidad&rdquo; bajo la ley ADA. Por definici&oacute;n, un individuo calificado deber&aacute; poder hacer las funciones esenciales del empleo con o sin acomodaciones razonables. Las acomodaciones efectivas son, con frecuencia, acomodaciones menores que requieren un gasto m&iacute;nimo o ninguno. Las acomodaciones efectivas deber&aacute;n ser siempre concebidas e implementadas en colaboraci&oacute;n con el empleado que tiene la MS &ndash; el empleado tiene el mayor conocimiento acerca de su enfermedad, sus limitaciones, y las acomodaciones que tienen un potencial grande de efectividad. De hecho, la mayor&iacute;a de las personas con MS han desarrollado y empleado ellos mismos una variedad de acomodaciones informales. Los empleados con MS pueden requerir acomodaciones para varias limitaciones y es importante que esas acomodaciones sean coordinadas con el empleador.</p>  <p><strong>Fatiga.</strong> Durante o inmediatamente despu&eacute;s de una exacerbaci&oacute;n, un individuo puede sentirse profundamente fatigado y puede que necesite limitar sus actividades de trabajo por varias semanas. Otras veces, el empleado podr&aacute; con frecuencia identificar el tiempo durante el cual &eacute;l o ella tienen m&aacute;s energ&iacute;a. No es extra&ntilde;o que un individuo reporte que su &ldquo;mejor tiempo&rdquo; es por la ma&ntilde;ana y que ellos se van fatigando progresivamente durante el d&iacute;a. Una modificaci&oacute;n del horario de trabajo puede ser muy &uacute;til para que el empleado pueda ocuparse de las labores que requieren m&aacute;s esfuerzo f&iacute;sico y cognitivo por la ma&ntilde;ana. Las estrategias que ayuden a &ldquo;economizar&rdquo; energ&iacute;a pueden ser tambi&eacute;n de mucha ayuda. Por ejemplo, algunas formas de evitar muchas vueltas y gastos de energ&iacute;a innecesario son reduciendo el tiempo necesario para viajar combinando los viajes a la maquina fotocopiadora, o viajes fuera del edificio, o utilizando una patineta motorizada para hacer los viajes que est&eacute;n m&aacute;s de 10 pies de retirado del escritorio. Incluir un tiempo de descanso puede ser tambi&eacute;n de mucha ayuda. Muchas personas que viven con MS reportan que los descansos de 10 minutos, aunque breves, pueden ayudarles a terminar el d&iacute;a. El truco est&aacute; en programar los descansos con la frecuencia suficiente para perturbar el desarrollo de una fatiga fuerte.</p>  <p>La opci&oacute;n de trabajar desde la casa puede ser tambi&eacute;n de mucha ayuda, ya que el proceso de ir y regresar al trabajo requiere de mucha energ&iacute;a. Muchas personas con MS reportan que si pueden trabajar por una porci&oacute;n del d&iacute;a o tener unas semanas de trabajo desde su casa, son m&aacute;s productivos y se fatigan menos. Independientemente de los ajustes en el trabajo, las siguientes acomodaciones ergon&oacute;micas tambi&eacute;n limitan la fatiga.</p>  <p><strong>Debilidad Motora.</strong> Un ambiente de trabajo ergon&oacute;mico es un paso cr&iacute;tico en el proceso de una acomodaci&oacute;n. Aseg&uacute;rese que el empleado est&aacute; posicionado apropiadamente en la silla para minimizar el dolor y la fatiga, y que las labores de las cuales el empleado debe ocuparse est&aacute;n colocadas ergon&oacute;micamente. Al considerar la composici&oacute;n de una oficina, este incluye no s&oacute;lo el teclado, sino tambi&eacute;n el rat&oacute;n de la computadora, herramientas alternativas de acceso a la computadora, la altura del monitor, etc. Hay un n&uacute;mero de estaciones de trabajo ajustables a precio razonable que permiten que el teclado, el rat&oacute;n y el monitor sean colocados en forma independiente.</p>  <p>Algunos empleados encontrar&aacute;n de mucha ayuda el usar software con reconocimiento de voz como Dragon Naturally Speaking. Este software les permite a los empleados dictar texto a la computadora. El uso de la computadora se hace m&aacute;s eficiente cuando las labores de rutina son automatizadas usando el lenguaje macro, ya sea con un identificador de voz o utilizando un teclado. Por ejemplo, en Microsoft Word, el dispositivo de texto autom&aacute;tico puede ser empleado para que el usuario pueda sustituir una combinaci&oacute;n de dos o tres letras por bloque del texto usado con m&aacute;s frecuencia. Tambi&eacute;n el usar teclados concisos puede reducir la fatiga y un dispositivo alternativo de rat&oacute;n tambi&eacute;n puede mejorar el acceso a la computadora. Un empleado puede probar una variedad de dispositivos comerciales que se encuentran en la mayor&iacute;a de tiendas de computaci&oacute;n. Puede ser que el empleado quiera considerar el mantener alg&uacute;n tipo de equipo m&oacute;vil motorizado en el trabajo, tal como una patineta o una silla de ruedas autom&aacute;tica, que le facilite el moverse de un lugar a otro en el sitio de trabajo. Consideraciones similares deben de hacerse por igual en otros sitios de trabajo.</p>  <p><strong>Cambios en la Visi&oacute;n</strong>. Los cambios en la visi&oacute;n son con frecuencia cambios transitorios, pero la visi&oacute;n puede deteriorarse con el paso del tiempo. Computadoras con monitores de alta calidad y con buen contraste proveen una buena base para una estaci&oacute;n con computadora. El software para agrandar la pantalla y mejorar el contraste en la pantalla, est&aacute; incluido en los sistemas de operaci&oacute;n de Microsoft como en Windows 98 y Windows 2000. Un software excelente para agrandar la pantalla, que tambi&eacute;n &ldquo;lee&rdquo; al usuario por medio de un sintetizador de voz, est&aacute; disponible por medio de distribuidores como Zoom Text. Un Circuito cerrado de televisi&oacute;n (CCTV) puede ser usado por los empleados para mejorar el contraste en la pantalla y el tama&ntilde;o de las letras. Hay varios lentes fijos y movibles que pueden permitirle a las personas agrandar el texto en sus documentos de trabajo. Las acomodaciones para los cambios de visi&oacute;n requieren, con frecuencia, el consultar con un especialista en la visi&oacute;n reducida.</p>  <p><strong>Control de las ganas de orinar o defecar</strong>. Estos problemas son usualmente manejados por el empleado y su equipo m&eacute;dico. Como una acomodaci&oacute;n, puede ser que el empleador necesite proveer un f&aacute;cil acceso a los sanitarios, darle al empleado oportunidad para que se cambie de ropa, la oportunidad de programar cuidadosamente las comidas y, tal vez, la opci&oacute;n de trabajar desde su casa durante las horas en que los problemas para controlar las ganas de orinar o defecar son m&aacute;s severos.</p>  <p><strong>Cambios de la sensaci&oacute;n</strong>. La acomodaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s com&uacute;n en el lugar de trabajo para los cambios de sensaci&oacute;n est&aacute; relacionada con la p&eacute;rdida de sensaci&oacute;n en los dedos y manos. Esta p&eacute;rdida de sensaci&oacute;n estar&iacute;a acompa&ntilde;ada con frecuencia por la p&eacute;rdida de fuerzas. Cuando alguien est&aacute; perdiendo la sensaci&oacute;n, se le hace m&aacute;s dif&iacute;cil manipular objetos peque&ntilde;os y escribir con un teclado. La utilizaci&oacute;n del teclado se puede facilitar colocando Velcro u otros est&iacute;mulos t&aacute;ctiles en las teclas &ldquo;localizadoras&rdquo; o usando software que confirme las teclas pulsadas. Tambi&eacute;n, el experimentar en la computadora con diferentes dispositivos de indicaci&oacute;n como las palancas de mando podr&iacute;a ser de mucha ayuda. Para algunas personas el sistema de reconocimiento de voz descrito con anterioridad los ayuda mucho porque reduce la cantidad requerida de escritura en el teclado. Para los trabajos de ensamblaje o tareas relacionadas se pueden dise&ntilde;ar cosas para agarrar o guiar objetos y partes peque&ntilde;as.</p>  <p><strong>Cambios cognitivos</strong>. La idea de que puedan requerir acomodaciones por experimentar cambios cognitivos puede ser aterrador para un empleado, pero muchas de esas acomodaciones son en realidad muy simples, no estorban, y permiten a los empleados trabajar con m&aacute;s efectividad. En algunos casos, las acomodaciones son tan intuitivas y eficaces que ?otros empleados tambi&eacute;n las quieren! Las acomodaciones para la fatiga, descritas anteriormente, pueden tambi&eacute;n ayudar a controlar los cambios cognitivos ya que los dos est&aacute;n con frecuencia entrelazados. Mucha gente utiliza libros o calendarios de recordatorio (por ejemplo, ayudantes digitales personales) para ayudarles con problemas de la memoria. Algunos empleados se mandan, ellos mismos por correo electr&oacute;nico, recordatorios de su lista de &ldquo;cosas por hacer&rdquo; para mantenerlos en su carpeta de entrada. Los programas de pantalla en la computadora tales como Microsoft Outlook pueden ayudar a manejar horarios, &ldquo;cosas por hacer&rdquo; y las listas de contactos. Estos programas de calendario se pueden tambi&eacute;n configurar para enviar mensajes de texto de cosas escritas en el calendario a los tel&eacute;fonos celulares o a un localizador m&oacute;vil que acepten mensajes de texto. Esto le permite a un empleado poner recordatorios en un sistema de calendario de la computadora y programarlo para que le env&iacute;e recordatorios a su localizador m&oacute;vil durante el d&iacute;a. Otras cosas que pueden ser muy &uacute;tiles ser&iacute;an, una reestructuraci&oacute;n de las tareas de trabajo para maximizar la rutina, reducir las distracciones, y ordenar el esfuerzo del trabajo para as&iacute; reducir la necesidad de las tareas m&uacute;ltiples. Los patrones y los empleados con MS deben de empezar completando un an&aacute;lisis de las demandas cognitivas del trabajo, incluyendo las demandas interpersonales, antes de empezar con un proceso de acomodaciones.</p>  <p><strong>S&iacute;ntomas impredecibles</strong>. Es importante considerar la progresi&oacute;n de la MS al considerar las acomodaciones en el lugar de trabajo para personas con MS. Mientras la progresi&oacute;n de las limitaciones no puede ser pronosticada, tiene sentido que al planear acomodaciones basadas en las necesidades actuales, se tomen en cuenta las necesidades futuras. Las acomodaciones deben tomar en cuenta los episodios de exacerbaci&oacute;n en los cuales el empleado puede requerir una semana de hospitalizaci&oacute;n para recuperarse, y quiz&aacute;s requiera de un retorno breve y graduado al trabajo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Trabajando y Viviendo con Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple (MS)</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La mayor&iacute;a de las personas con MS est&aacute;n en edad de trabajo y quieren continuar trabajando o, si no est&aacute;n trabajando actualmente, volver a la fuerza laboral. Muchas personas con MS no tienen limitaciones que puedan afectar su empleo. Para esos individuos que tienen limitaciones significativas relacionadas con la MS que afectan su empleo, muchos de ellos pueden trabajar con acomodaciones razonables que, son t&iacute;picamente, de menor importancia en &iacute;ndole. Debido a los actuales avances m&eacute;dicos relacionados con la MS y avances en conocimiento y en la tecnolog&iacute;a relacionada con acomodaciones en el empleo, la MS presentar&aacute; menos barreras al empleo en un futuro cercano.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recursos</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p><strong>Sociedad Nacional de Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple</strong><br /> www.nmss.org</p>  <p><strong>Centros de Asesor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica en Discapacidades e Industria</strong><br /> 949-4232, www.adata.org</p>  <p><strong>Red de Acomodaci&oacute;n Laboral</strong>,<br /> 1-800-526-7234, <br /> www.janwebicdi.wvu.edu</p>  <p><strong>Comit&eacute; Presidencial de Empleo para Personas con Discapacidades</strong>,<br /> 1-202-376-6200, <br />www.pcepd.gov</p>  <p><strong>Centro de Entrenamiento e Investigaci&oacute;n de Esclerosis M&uacute;ltiple de la Universidad de Washington</strong><br />www.msrrtc.washington.edu</p>  <p><strong>Departamento de Justicia de los Estados Unidos</strong><br /> 1-800-514-0301, <br /> www.usdoj.gov/crt/ada/adahom1.htm</p>  <p><strong>Comisi&oacute;n de Igualdad de Oportunidad en el Empleo de los Estados Unidos (EEOC)</strong><br /> Para la oficina del sitio m&aacute;s cercano llamar al 1-800-669-EEOC (voz), 800-800-3302 (TTY). <br /> Para publicaciones en cuestiones relacionadas con el empleo y la ADA, llame al 1-800-669-4000 (voz), 800-669-6820 (TTY). <br /> Para informaci&oacute;n en espa&ntilde;ol acuda a la Red Electr&oacute;nica:<br /> http://www.eeoc.gov/languages/spanish/index.html</p>  <p><strong>Proyectos de la Ley de Asistencia Tecnol&oacute;gica</strong> en cada estado y para informaci&oacute;n o referencias relacionadas a la tecnolog&iacute;a de asistencia.<br /> http://www.resna.org/taproject/at/statecontacts.html</p>  </div>  <h2>Declaraci&oacute;n de Exclusi&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Este material fue elaborado por el Programa de Empleo y Discapacidades, Escuela de Relaciones Laborales e Industriales - Divisi&oacute;n de Extensi&oacute;n, Universidad de Cornell, y financiado con fondos del Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones en Discapacidad y Rehabilitaci&oacute;n (Concesi&oacute;n No. H133D10155).

Una lesi&oacute;n en la espina dorsal interfiere los mensajes entre el cerebro y el resto del cuerpo y tiene como resultado la par&aacute;lisis y p&eacute;rdida de sensibilidad debajo de donde ocurre la lesi&oacute;n. El lugar en donde ocurre la lesi&oacute;n y la severidad de la misma determina las limitaciones f&iacute;sicas que tendr&aacute; la persona. Individuos con SCI tienen una expectaci&oacute;n de vida casi-normal y pueden desempe&ntilde;ar una amplia variedad de posiciones de empleo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodando Individuos con SCI</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las limitaciones f&iacute;sicas impuestas por SCI pueden, algunas veces, interferir con el desempe&ntilde;o de las tareas del empleo. Sin embargo, las acomodaciones en el empleo, pueden resolver muchos de los problemas de desempe&ntilde;o en las tareas y permitir que una persona sea un empleado competente y productivo.</p>  <p>La Ley para Personas con Discapacidades (ADA), requiere que los empleadores provean acomodaciones razonables a individuos calificados con discapacidades para que ellos puedan 1) participar en el proceso de solicitud de empleo; 2) desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales del empleo; 3) y disfrutar de los beneficios equitativos y los beneficios propios de un empleo.</p>  <p>Las acomodaciones razonables relacionadas con el desempe&ntilde;o del trabajo pueden tomar muchas formas, incluyendo: el hacer el lugar de trabajo accesible; el reasignar las funciones marginales que el individuo no puede desempe&ntilde;ar a causa de su discapacidad o cambiando c&oacute;mo y cu&aacute;ndo cualquier funci&oacute;n del empleo es hecha; proporcionando horarios modificados de trabajo o de tiempo parcial; el uso de permisos cuando sea necesario; el obtener equipo auxiliar especial o modificar el equipo existente; el proveer asistentes para que ayuden con las labores del empleo; el proveer estacionamiento reservado; y permitir que el empleado utilice equipo, ayuda o servicios que no necesariamente esta el empleador obligado a proveerlos, tales como un perro gu&iacute;a.</p>  <p>Los empleadores no est&aacute;n en la obligaci&oacute;n de proveer acomodaciones que representen una inconveniencia excesiva. La inconveniencia excesiva deber&aacute; ser basada en una evaluaci&oacute;n individual de las circunstancias presentes que demuestren que una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable espec&iacute;fica causar&iacute;a mucha dificultad o un gasto grande para el empleador. La inconveniencia excesiva es evaluada a trav&eacute;s de varios factores, incluyendo la clase y el costo neto de la acomodaci&oacute;n; el n&uacute;mero de empleados, tipo de operaciones y recursos financieros de la empresa y el tama&ntilde;o de la entidad comercial de la cual puede ser parte; y el impacto que la acomodaci&oacute;n pueda causar en el funcionamiento de la instalaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>Consideraciones en el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Bajo la Ley para Personas con Discapacidades, los empleadores deben de hacer acomodaciones razonables para un individuo calificado con una discapacidad conocida, ya sea f&iacute;sica o mental. Con SCI, la discapacidad es f&iacute;sica y usualmente es visible.</p>  <p>El aspirante seguramente estar&aacute; usando una silla de ruedas manual o el&eacute;ctrica, o estar&aacute; usando un equipo auxiliar para caminar. Sin embargo, la presencia de la discapacidad, no debe ser el punto principal a considerar durante el proceso de selecci&oacute;n de empleo. Al contrario, el proceso debe concentrarse en si el nivel de educaci&oacute;n, la experiencia y destrezas del aspirante satisfacen los requisitos del empleo y si &eacute;l o ella podr&aacute;n desempe&ntilde;ar las funciones esenciales y previamente documentadas del empleo con o sin una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable. El empleador puede iniciar una charla compartiendo y discutiendo la descripci&oacute;n del empleo. La descripci&oacute;n de un empleo debe de incluir las funciones esenciales, las funciones secundarias o marginales, los requisitos m&iacute;nimos, el lugar del empleo y el equipo que se ha de usarse para desempe&ntilde;ar el trabajo.</p>  <p>El empleador puede preguntar a los aspirantes si pueden hacer todas o parte de las funciones del empleo, incluyendo si pueden hacerlas &ldquo;con o sin acomodaciones razonables.&rdquo; Algunos individuos, sin embargo, tienen otros problemas como resultado de su lesi&oacute;n en la espina dorsal que pueden ser menos visuales. Entre estos se incluyen fatiga, dolor, y poca tolerancia al calor. Si la discapacidad de un aspirante es obvia o ha sido revelada por la persona discapacitada, el empleador puede pedir al aspirante que describa o demuestre como es que &eacute;l o ella desempe&ntilde;ar&aacute;n las funciones requeridas del empleo. Esto mismo puede ser preguntado si el empleador cree, con raz&oacute;n, que la persona no podr&aacute; desempe&ntilde;ar dichas funciones. Sin embargo, cualquier petici&oacute;n de una acomodaci&oacute;n razonable, ser&aacute;n hechas por el individuo con la discapacidad.</p>  <p>El aspirante con SCI puede requerir alguna forma de acomodaci&oacute;n para as&iacute; poder participar en el proceso de selecci&oacute;n de empleados. Algunos ejemplos de acomodaciones razonables que pueden ser de mucha ayuda durante este proceso son:</p>  <ul>  <li>enviando una solicitud por correo a quienes la soliciten</li>  <li>ofreciendo los servicios de una persona que pueda asistirle a llenar la solicitud</li>  <li>disponiendo de un estacionamiento accesible cercano</li>  <li>usando una mesa de altura ajustable o un escritorio que provea suficiente espacio para una persona que usa una silla de ruedas</li>  <li>moviendo el lugar de la entrevista a una localidad accesible o aun mejor, removiendo los obst&aacute;culos f&iacute;sicos por medio de la instalaci&oacute;n de una rampa, un abridor de puertas autom&aacute;tico o haciendo m&aacute;s amplias las entradas y corredores.</li>  <li>cerciorarce de la accesibilidad del sitio donde usted a de conducir la entrevista. Asegure el acceso a su estacionamiento, edificio y sitio/localidad de la entrevista.</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Resolviendo problemas comunes del trabajo</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El tipo de problemas en el trabajo (si es que los hay), que cualquier empleado con SCI puede tener, depender&aacute;n del grado de lesi&oacute;n del individuo, requerimientos f&iacute;sicos del empleo y el ambiente de trabajo. Puede ser que se necesiten algunas acomodaciones para que la persona pueda desempe&ntilde;ar exitosamente las funciones esenciales del empleo. Es muy posible que el empleado sepa que tipo de acomodaciones necesita. Contrario con lo que cree mucha gente, las acomodaciones son generalmente baratas. Investigaciones hechas al respecto muestran que la mayor&iacute;a de acomodaciones cuestan menos de $5001 d&oacute;lares y muchas no cuestan nada. Tambi&eacute;n hay, con frecuencia, varias acomodaciones diferentes que pueden resolver el problema. Algunos ejemplos de problemas de trabajo y c&oacute;mo han sido resueltos son:</p>  <p><em>Escritorios est&aacute;ndar que son muy bajos para el acceso de una silla de ruedas</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Quite el caj&oacute;n del centro</li>  <li>Levante el escritorio con bloques de madera</li>  <li>Compre escritorios m&aacute;s altos o de altura ajustable</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Centro del escritorio con pedestal muy estrecho para el acceso de una silla de ruedas</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Compre una mesa</li>  <li>Compre un escritorio en forma de L con un espacio amplio para una silla de ruedas</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Dificultad en detener el auricular del tel&eacute;fono a causa de un funcionamiento limitado de una mano o brazo</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Provea un tel&eacute;fono con micr&oacute;fono y bocina</li>  <li>Compre un tel&eacute;fono con aud&iacute;fonos</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Dificultad al usar un rat&oacute;n o teclado est&aacute;ndar a causa de una discapacidad en una mano o brazo</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Provea un tenedor para teclado a una altura apropiada</li>  <li>Provea una bola-rodante para sustituir al rat&oacute;n</li>  <li>Compre hardware o software que provea un acceso alternativo como un sistema activado de voz o de c&oacute;digo Morse.</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Dificultad al manejar papeles a causa de una funci&oacute;n limitada de las manos</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Provea un sostenedor para libros,</li>  <li>estantes para cat&aacute;logos,</li>  <li>sostenedor para copias,</li>  <li>archivos verticales de mesa,</li>  <li>sostenedor Lazy Susan de mesa,</li>  <li>volteadores de p&aacute;gina autom&aacute;tico.</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Dificultad para entrar a las instalaciones</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Provea estacionamiento reservado para personas con discapacidades</li>  <li>Provea una ruta accesible del estacionamiento a las instalaciones</li>  <li>D&eacute; mantenimiento a los lugares accesibles: asegur&aacute;ndose que los pasillo de transitar sean firme y estable, remover la nieve, y dar mantenimiento a los elevadores o plataforma mec&aacute;nica de transporte.</li>  <li>Ponga cerraduras de palancas en todas las puertas</li>  <li>Provea abridores de puertas autom&aacute;ticos, para puertas pesadas</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Dificultades dentro de las instalaciones</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Ensanche los corredores a una medida de 32 pulgadas o a&ntilde;ada bisagras no visibles que pueden a&ntilde;adir de 1 a 1.5 pulgadas de ampliaci&oacute;n.</li>  <li>Mantenga un pasillo de al menos 36 pulgadas libre de muebles, ficheros, u otros objetos</li>  <li>Mantenga los materiales e informaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s usados en estantes o mesas peque&ntilde;as y no use los cajones de arriba de los ficheros si una persona no puede alcanzarlos</li>  </ul>  <p><em>Problemas para entrar a los sanitarios</em></p>  <ul>  <li>Coloque los espejos y dispensadores de papel a una altura baja</li>  <li>Coloque los lavamanos a una altura que provea un espacio libre para las rodillas y cubra las tuber&iacute;as</li>  <li>Combine dos compartimientos en el sanitario y haga uno m&aacute;s grande</li>  <li>Agregue inodoros elevados o asientos para el inodoro</li>  <li>Agregue barras fijas que ayuden a sostenerse</li>  </ul>  <p><em>En las rutinas matinales para el cuidado personal, se pueden necesitar cambios en los horarios de trabajo </em></p>  <ul>  <li>Permita un horario flexible</li>  <li>Permita trabajar tiempo parcial desde la casa</li>  <li>Provea empleo de tiempo parcial</li>  </ul>  </div>  <h2>Conservando a los empleados</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Cualquiera experimenta problemas de cambio funcional conforme envejece. Para los individuos con SCI, al igual que con otras discapacidades, estos cambios ocurren prematuramente y afectan el desempe&ntilde;o del trabajo. Los cambios funcionales pueden incluir fatiga, dolor en las articulaciones de las extremidades superiores, adem&aacute;s de debilitamiento, dolor y rigidez de los m&uacute;sculos. El impacto que estos cambios tienen en el trabajo puede ser ignorado por un tiempo ya que los cambios pueden ocurrir gradualmente. Puede ser que las mismas acomodaciones que pueden permitirle al empleado empezar a trabajar, le permitan continuar trabajando con &eacute;xito y ser un empleado productivo. Para poder mantenerse saludables, la salud y el bienestar son de vital importancia para los empleados con SCI y cualquier programa prove&iacute;do por la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a debe ser revisado para asegurarse que sea accesible para todos los empleados.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recursos de Ayuda para Acomodaciones</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Cuando sean necesario acomodaciones razonables, el empleado con la discapacidad puede ser su mayor recurso para identificar posibles acomodaciones y determinar la efectividad de ellas. Durante su estancia en el empleo, la necesidad de acomodaciones razonables para un individuo puede ocurrir en cualquier momento. El proceso de acomodaci&oacute;n es flexible y puede que se necesite revisar las acomodaciones peri&oacute;dicamente para determinar su efectividad y en conformidad con las necesidades del empleado, que pueden disminuir o aumentar. Aunque, idealmente, se debe de dar preferencia a lo que escoge el empleado, el empleador se guarda el derecho de escoger entre todas las acomodaciones eficaces. La ADA no requiere a los empleadores proveer acomodaciones que representen una inconveniencia excesiva en el funcionamiento de la empresa. Cuando hay problemas para identificar una acomodaci&oacute;n o las alternativas deseadas, una asesor&iacute;a t&eacute;cnica puede ser de mucha ayuda para determinar como acomodar a un empleado en una situaci&oacute;n espec&iacute;fica. Hay una variedad de recursos que pueden ayudarle a identificar e implementar las acomodaciones o para ayudarle a entender sus obligaciones bajo los estatutos de la ADA.</p>  <p><strong>Centro Regional de Asesor&iacute;a T&eacute;cnica en Discapacidad e Industria (DBTAC)</strong><br /> (800) 949-4232 (Su llamada ser&aacute; transferida al DBTAC en su localidad)<br /> www.adata.org/dbtac.html<br /> <em> Provee informaci&oacute;n gratis y copias de documentos de la ADA.

Sin embargo, una persona puede estar legalmente ciega si tiene, ya sea&hellip;</p>  <ul>  <li>una visi&oacute;n de 20/200 en los dos ojos aun con la mejor correcci&oacute;n, o</li>  <li>un campo de visi&oacute;n restringido de 200 o menos.</li>  </ul>  <p>Una persona que tiene su mejor visi&oacute;n, aun corregida, de 20/70 a 20/200 com&uacute;nmente se le llama &ldquo;limitaci&oacute;n visual&rdquo; o que tiene &ldquo;poca vista.&rdquo;</p>  <p>Algunas personas nacen sin poder ver o con una visi&oacute;n significantemente reducida. Otros pierden la vista a causa de accidentes o por el proceso natural de envejecimiento, que usualmente empieza en los a&ntilde;os 40&rsquo;s. Para algunos, la p&eacute;rdida de vista es repentina, mientras para otros la p&eacute;rdida visual puede ser gradual. Algunas condiciones como diabetes, por ejemplo, causa que la visi&oacute;n fluct&uacute;e de un d&iacute;a a otro.</p>  <p>Algunas personas que han perdido niveles significantes de funcionamiento de la vista toman un tiempo libre de sus carreras para aprender destrezas alternativas que les permitan vivir y trabajar de forma independiente.</p>  <p>Si una persona con ceguera o limitaci&oacute;n visual solicita un trabajo en su empresa, puede indicar en su curr&iacute;culum vitae y la solicitud su experiencia y habilidades.</p>  </div>  <h2>&iquest;Qu&eacute; tipo de trabajo puede hacer una persona con ceguera?</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Con entrenamiento y equipo auxiliar apropiado, la gente con ceguera o deficiencia visual tienen la misma capacidad y habilidades que cualquier otra persona. No hay \"trabajos para personas con ceguera.\" Para ampliar su forma de pensar, considere que hay personas con ceguera que han sobresalido como son:</p>  <ul>  <li>Artistas</li>  <li>maquinistas</li>  <li>auto-mec&aacute;nicos</li>  <li>masajistas</li>  <li>constructores de barcos</li>  <li>alcaldes</li>  <li>programadores de computaci&oacute;n</li>  <li>abogados</li>  <li>m&uacute;sicos</li>  <li>modelos de moda</li>  <li>trabajadores de producci&oacute;n</li>  <li>maestros</li>  <li>cuentistas</li>  <li>especialistas en procesamiento de datos</li>  </ul>  <p>La limitaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s grande que muchas personas con ceguera y deficiencia visual enfrentan es, con frecuencia, la percepci&oacute;n que tiene un empleador de su discapacidad.</p>  </div>  <h2>Acomodando a una persona con ceguera o deficiencia visual durante el proceso de selecci&oacute;n de empleados</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Durante el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n, un empleador busca determinar si un solicitante tiene la experiencia, habilidades necesarias, y educaci&oacute;n u otro historial de trabajo para poder desarrollar con efectividad las funciones esenciales del trabajo. Esta informaci&oacute;n, es la misma que todo empleador necesita de cualquier solicitante para as&iacute; tomar una decisi&oacute;n adecuada al contratar a una persona.</p>  <p>Una persona con ceguera o deficiencia visual que no puede ver lo suficiente para leer una solicitud, puede desanimarse al llenar una solicitud, a&uacute;n si el trabajo solo requiere una visi&oacute;n m&iacute;nima.</p>  <p>Hay que preguntar al solicitante como &eacute;l o ella quiere completar los requerimientos para el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n. Por ejemplo, si usted requiere que los solicitantes llenen un formulario de solicitud, pregunte al candidato que ser&iacute;a m&aacute;s conveniente:</p>  <ul>  <li>Enviarle la solicitud por correo al candidato que lo solicite</li>  <li>Ofrecer al individuo que se presenta en persona la oportunidad de llevarse la solicitud para que alguien le ayude a llenarla y regresarla en persona o por correo</li>  <li>Ofrecer los servicios de alguien en la oficina para que le ayude a llenar la solicitud.</li>  </ul>  <p>Cuando usted invite a una persona con ceguera o deficiencia visual a una entrevista:</p>  <ul>  <li>Pregunte si &eacute;l o ella necesita instrucciones para llegar, si es que alguien m&aacute;s est&aacute; manejando</li>  <li>Si el candidato toma transportaci&oacute;n p&uacute;blica, indique cual parada es la m&aacute;s cercana y luego d&eacute;le instrucciones para llegar.</li>  <li>Ofr&eacute;zcale ayuda desde el &aacute;rea de recepci&oacute;n hasta su oficina pregunt&aacute;ndoles, &ldquo;&iquest;le gustar&iacute;a tomarse de mi brazo?&rdquo; Si la persona necesita ayuda, &eacute;l o ella tomar&aacute;n su brazo de arriba del codo y lo seguir&aacute;n un paso detr&aacute;s de usted. No insista en ayudar y, ciertamente, no ponga a la persona enfrente de usted. Si la persona utiliza un perro gu&iacute;a, el perro le seguir&aacute;. No acaricie o distraiga al perro.</li>  <li>Al llegar a su oficina, pregunte si puede ponerle la mano en el respaldo de la silla que le est&aacute; ofreciendo. No empuje a la persona para que se siente.</li>  </ul>  <p>Cuando una persona con ceguera o deficiencia visual est&aacute; en su oficina: Sea usted mismo. Mantenga una conversaci&oacute;n normal. Es correcto preguntar:</p>  <ul>  <li>\"&iquest;Si ve a lo que me refiero?\"</li>  <li>&ldquo;&iquest;Quisiera ver el &aacute;rea de trabajo?&rdquo;</li>  <li>&ldquo;Espero verlo de nuevo.&rdquo;</li>  </ul>  <p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  <h2>Mejorando la productividad en el trabajo</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los sujetadores de Velcro en la ropa protectora, carros de mano, y procesadores de texto permiten que hagamos cosas que de otra forma ser&iacute;an dif&iacute;ciles. Estas herramientas aumentan nuestra productividad acomodando razonablemente nuestra naturaleza humana.</p>  <p>La ley para Personas con Discapacidades (ADA por sus siglas en ingl&eacute;s), nos pide &ldquo;acomodar razonablemente&rdquo; las limitaciones impuestas por discapacidad mental o f&iacute;sica de una persona. Se define como acomodaciones razonables a la modificaci&oacute;n o ajuste de una tarea, pr&aacute;cticas de empleo, o al lugar de trabajo que hace posible que una persona calificada con una discapacidad pueda ser empleada. El empleador necesita considerar acomodaciones razonables desde el primer contacto con la persona con discapacidad, durante el proceso de contrataci&oacute;n, en la labor, en el entrenamiento, en el lugar de trabajo y al considerar promociones y despidos.</p>  <p>Si los deberes del trabajo cambian, puede que se necesiten acomodaciones nuevas. La ADA requiere que los empleadores acomoden a un individuo discapacitado a menos que el hacerlo cause una inconveniencia excesiva. Si el costo es una inconveniencia excesiva, el empleador puede pedir a la persona discapacitada que provea su propia acomodaci&oacute;n o asistirle a encontrar recursos para pagarla. Si pensamos que las acomodaciones son &ldquo;reforzadores de productividad&rdquo; al igual que otras herramientas en el lugar de trabajo, se convierten en parte del costo del negocio.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tipos de reforzadores de productividad</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>El empleador y el empleado deben llegar a un acuerdo e investigar acerca de equipo auxiliar o una reestructuraci&oacute;n de las tareas. La persona que pida las acomodaciones debe de haber vivido, y tal vez trabajado, con la discapacidad y puede que conozca mejor que clase de equipo auxiliar reforzara la productividad m&aacute;s eficazmente. Un equipo tecnol&oacute;gico de asistencia puede ser una cosa, una pieza de un equipo o un aparato de producci&oacute;n, ya sea adquirido en una tienda comercial, hecho a la medida o modificado y que se utiliza para aumentar, mantener o mejorar las habilidades de un individuo discapacitado. Los servicios de tecnolog&iacute;a de asistencia son cualquier servicio que directamente provee ayuda a un individuo discapacitado en la selecci&oacute;n, adquisici&oacute;n o uso de un dispositivo de tecnolog&iacute;a de asistencia.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tecnolog&iacute;a poco avanzada de asistencia</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los reforzadores de productividad no tienen que ser caros o lujosos.</p>  <ul>  <li>Un pedazo de silicona en una palanca, apagador o bot&oacute;n le permite a una persona alinear los controles en una maquina.</li>  <li>Marcadores de punta amplia pueden hacer las etiquetas de una carpeta m&aacute;s legibles.</li>  <li>Etiquetas Braille en una maquina de sodas permiten al que lee Braille un acceso equitativo al sabor de su preferencia.</li>  <li>Tiras adhesivas de diferente tama&ntilde;o para identificar las partes en los cubos de producci&oacute;n.</li>  </ul>  <p>Consulte con su empleado que tiene ceguera o deficiencia visual si hay otras soluciones sencillas.</p>  </div>  <h2>Tecnolog&iacute;a muy avanzada de asistencia</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Las computadoras modernas o programas de adaptaci&oacute;n pueden ser utilizados para proveer im&aacute;genes grandes en la pantalla y para dispositivos de salida de habla o de escritura Braille. Los precios pueden variar de estado a estado y est&aacute;n sujetos a cambio.</p>  <ul>  <li>Un esc&aacute;ner &oacute;ptico, tambi&eacute;n conocido como &ldquo;maquina de leer&rdquo; procesa material impreso y &ldquo;lo lee&rdquo; a una computadora o sintetizador de voz. Algunos esc&aacute;neres requieren solamente a&ntilde;adir un monitor externo a un sistema existente de computaci&oacute;n. Muchos de los nuevos esc&aacute;neres, conectados a una computadora, requieren s&oacute;lo de una conexi&oacute;n de L&iacute;nea de Serie Universal (USB). El precio de un esc&aacute;ner puede variar de $250 a $700 d&oacute;lares. El software especializado y dise&ntilde;ado para una persona con ceguera, costar&iacute;a alrededor de $995 d&oacute;lares. Un sistema independiente OCR, sin un monitor cuesta aproximadamente $2,900 d&oacute;lares. Afortunadamente, muchas oficinas ya cuentan con este equipo auxiliar.</li>  <li>Programas para agrandar la pantalla, utilizan software para agrandar el texto en la pantalla de una computadora desde 2X hasta 16X. El utilizar monitores de 17 a 18 pulgadas tambi&eacute;n ayudar&iacute;a a los empleados que utilizan ese tipo de programas de agrandamiento. &ldquo;Zoom Text&rdquo;, el fabricante l&iacute;der de agrandamiento de texto cuesta aproximadamente $595 d&oacute;lares.</li>  <li>Un sistema de habla accesible le permite a una persona con deficiencia visual escuchar una voz sintetizada de un dispositivo de salida que le pueda leer el texto del monitor en una computadora. Aunque alg&uacute;n software que depende del rat&oacute;n o que tiene muchos dibujos puede presentar dificultades, hay otras formas de abordar ese problema. Esos programas dan informaci&oacute;n auditiva de men&uacute;s, cuadros de di&aacute;logo, texto y otros mensajes com&uacute;nmente visualizados en Windows. Esos programas t&iacute;picamente cuestan entre $800 y $1,500 d&oacute;lares, y el software de producci&oacute;n de voz m&aacute;s actual y m&aacute;s usado, (JAWS para Work Speech) cuesta alrededor de $795 d&oacute;lares. Todos los programas con un dispositivo de salida que produce voz (lectores de pantalla y esc&aacute;neres &amp; sistemas de lectura) utilizan la tarjeta de sonido de la computadora para producir la voz. No es necesario un hardware adicional para que el dispositivo de salida pueda producir la voz.</li>  <li>Los dispositivos de salida Braille utilizan un dispositivo reparador que muestra hasta 80 s&iacute;mbolos de texto, lo cual es equivalente a una l&iacute;nea de texto en el monitor. El usuario puede moverse de una l&iacute;nea a otra y las c&eacute;lulas Braille cambian a la informaci&oacute;n nueva. Pantallas con sistema Braille t&iacute;picamente cuestan entre $3,400 a $15,000 d&oacute;lares.</li>  <li>Los documentos Braille pueden ser creados utilizando un programa de conversi&oacute;n Braille y un equipo de grabado Braille con papel Braille especial. Los programas de conversi&oacute;n t&iacute;picamente cuestan alrededor de $300 d&oacute;lares y el equipo de grabado Braille est&aacute; en un promedio de $3,000 d&oacute;lares.</li>  <li>Un sistema de lectura y un esc&aacute;ner pueden ser utilizados para leer material impreso. Tal sistema utiliza un esc&aacute;ner est&aacute;ndar para entrar una p&aacute;gina de texto a la computadora. Una vez dentro, el programa de adaptabilidad convierte la imagen en texto de computaci&oacute;n y lee la informaci&oacute;n en voz alta. El texto en la computadora puede ser guardado para leerlo despu&eacute;s. Un sistema de computadora-esc&aacute;ner y un sistema de lectura cuestan t&iacute;picamente de $1,000 a $1,500 d&oacute;lares por el programa y de $200 a $400 d&oacute;lares por el esc&aacute;ner.</li>  <li>Sistema de Circuito Cerrado de Televisi&oacute;n (CCTV), utiliza una c&aacute;mara modificada de movimiento para agrandar material impreso y mostrarlo en monitores de 14 a 21 pulgadas. Este sistema permite a una persona que tiene problemas con su vista leer memor&aacute;ndums, libros y llenar formularios. Los sistemas CCTV son con frecuencia la mejor forma en que una persona con algunos problemas de vista puede leer material impreso visualmente. Sistemas en blanco y negro cuestan un promedio de $2,000 d&oacute;lares. Los sistemas a color cuestan un promedio de $2,500 d&oacute;lares. Hay algunos sistemas que utilizan una c&aacute;mara de mano peque&ntilde;a que se conecta a una televisi&oacute;n. Estos sistemas cuestan entre $500 y $1,000 d&oacute;lares pero tienen limitaciones, ya que una persona debe detener la c&aacute;mara para poderlo usar. Adem&aacute;s, si la persona tiene una discapacidad f&iacute;sica, puede ser que &eacute;l o ella no puedan usar tal sistema.</li>  </ul>  <p>Todos estos programas de adaptabilidad funcionan en los sistemas Windows 95/98 y en la mayor&iacute;a de sistemas de Windows NT &amp; Windows 2000. La mayor&iacute;a de programas comerciales (tales como Office 2000, Quicken, etc.) funcionan conjuntamente con los programas de adaptabilidad sin ning&uacute;n problema. Si un programa comercial tiene un dispositivo de salida de audio, podr&iacute;a ocasionar un choque con los programas con dispositivo de salida de voz.</p>  <p>Antes de decidir si el costo de acomodaciones necesarias para aumentar la productividad de los trabajadores con deficiencias visuales es muy caro, hay que revisar el costo total del sistema de computaci&oacute;n actual de la empresa, los &ldquo;recursos financieros de las instalaciones&hellip;&rdquo; y los recursos financieros de toda la entidad en cuesti&oacute;n&hellip;&rdquo;. Una instalaci&oacute;n apropiada de la estaci&oacute;n de trabajo de un empleado ayuda a garantizar una productividad al m&aacute;ximo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recomendaciones para capacitaci&oacute;n en el trabajo</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Los empleados con ceguera o deficiencia visual necesitan la misma orientaci&oacute;n en un puesto y un entrenamiento inicial que alguien que puede ver bien. Provea orientaci&oacute;n acerca de la compa&ntilde;&iacute;a y el tipo de trabajo. Indague con el empleado si &eacute;l o ella aprenden mejor con instrucciones verbales o si prefieren una combinaci&oacute;n de aprendizaje con pr&aacute;ctica manual, por escrito y verbal.</p>  <p>Permita que la persona organice el &aacute;rea de trabajo para su mayor eficiencia, aun si eso amerita una organizaci&oacute;n diferente a como se ha hecho con anterioridad. Puede ser que el nuevo dise&ntilde;o aumente por igual la productividad de los dem&aacute;s empleados.</p>  <p>Hay que asegurarse que la estaci&oacute;n de trabajo est&aacute; equipada adecuadamente y que el empleado sabe donde encontrar las piezas de repuesto. Si el equipo ha sido prove&iacute;do por una organizaci&oacute;n externa, determine qui&eacute;n es responsable por la posesi&oacute;n, mantenimiento, mejoramiento, o reemplazo del mismo.</p>  </div>  <h2>Oficina de desempe&ntilde;o</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>La responsabilidad de un supervisor es la de establecer una atm&oacute;sfera de calidad y productividad. Es crucial tener entrenamiento de capacitaci&oacute;n apropiado en el trabajo. Se debe de asumir que un empleado con ceguera o deficiencia visual tiene las mismas aspiraciones de superaci&oacute;n que cualquier otro empleado y se debe de proveer el entrenamiento adecuado, asegur&aacute;ndose de que los materiales son accesibles para las limitaciones visuales de la persona.</p>  <p>Supervisar de la misma forma que a cualquier otro empleado. Asegurarse que todos los empleados entienden las expectaciones de desempe&ntilde;o. Proveer elogios y comentarios positivos. Si hay un problema por el desempe&ntilde;o, tr&aacute;telo abiertamente. No piense autom&aacute;ticamente que es relacionado con la discapacidad. No evite hacer comentarios. Los empleados con ceguera o deficiencia visual, al igual que todos los empleados, necesitan saber cuando est&aacute;n haciendo un buen trabajo y cuando es que necesitan hacer las cosas diferentes. Hay ocasiones en que un supervisor no provee comentarios hasta que un problema m&aacute;s grande aparece para luego correr al empleado. &iexcl;Ning&uacute;n empleado debe ser sometido a este tipo de acciones!</p>  <p>Haga elogios en el desempe&ntilde;o, utilizando el mismo criterio que con los otros empleados. Si un supervisor ha prove&iacute;do comentarios durante todo el a&ntilde;o, no debe de haber sorpresas en la evaluaci&oacute;n anual de desempe&ntilde;o.</p>  <p>Peri&oacute;dicamente, revise el equipo de adaptabilidad para asegurarse de que contin&uacute;a trabajando bien y que cubre las necesidades del empleado. Conforme la tecnolog&iacute;a avanza, los precios y la compatibilidad cambian. Determine si el equipo necesita mejoras y as&iacute; mantener al empleado a un nivel competitivo. Inf&oacute;rmese con su Agencia local de Rehabilitaci&oacute;n Vocacional, el Centro de Rehabilitaci&oacute;n para personas con Ceguera o un proveedor de servicios de rehabilitaci&oacute;n.</p>  </div>  <h2>Entrenamiento y Ascenso</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>A medida que el empleado crece en el trabajo, provea las mismas oportunidades para aprender y tomar nuevos retos que a los dem&aacute;s empleados. An&iacute;melo a superarse, aunque esto signifique atender entrenamientos fuera de la ciudad, hablar en conferencias profesionales o entrenar a trabajadores nuevos. Verifique con el empleado para identificar las acomodaciones necesarias.</p>  <p>Ayude a la persona en la planeaci&oacute;n de los pasos a seguir para tener una carrera exitosa. Ascienda a la persona calificada que tiene ceguera o deficiencia visual utilizando el mismo criterio de promoci&oacute;n que usa con los dem&aacute;s.</p>  </div>  <h2>Recursos</h2>  <div class=\"section\">  <p>Hay varios sitios con recursos para asistir a empleadores y personas con ceguera o deficiencia visual con adaptaciones de trabajo. Empiece toda discusi&oacute;n de acomodaciones con el empleado.

The overarching premise of the Center\'s activities is that persons with psychiatric disabilities have the right to maximal independence, which grows out of making choices regarding the decisions that affect their lives. Center projects are comprised of five core areas: choice in treatment decision-making; economic self-sufficiency; maintaining access to desired services under managed care; career development through real jobs for real wages; and strengthening self-determination skills and self-advocacy. Project activities are being implemented by multidisciplinary workgroups comprised of people with psychiatric disabilities, families, service providers, state agency administrators, researchers, and Center staff. Outcome and management tools being developed for each core area assess key outcomes and program policies related to increased self-determination. In the third year, a collaboratively-planned, state-of-the-science conference on self-determination and psychiatric disabilities will be convened and a comprehensive report will be published.
